 B33_becoming_corinite_title:0 "Embracing Corin"
 B33_becoming_corinite_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Blademarches has always been in a somewhat strange position when it comes to religious matters, with so much focus being placed on the role of Calindal and the Bladechosen King. This early concept of a ruler not legitimized by Castellos, but by a sort of rudimentary meritocracy, even if decided by a magic sword, put Blademarches at odds with the most conservative parts of the Regent Court, further complicated by many a conflict with the nearby kingdom of Adenica, who the Blademarchers have always considered somewhat pompous and indecisive, compared to their own rather pragmatic and driven nature. To fight alongside Corin, to see her drive evil from the land, to see her elevated to godhood for her good deeds, suddenly showed our people a new path forward, that at the same time felt as if it was always meant for them. So when the Xth Pantheonic Council instead decided to elevate Adean to Castellos vacant seat, the choice for Blademarches was clear."

Let the Corintar be her shield against the blasphemous attacks of the corrupt Regent Court - but all know that we are her sword, a mighty blade cutting through heresy and evil."

 B33_question_of_navy_title:0 "A Navy for Blademarches?"
 B33_question_of_navy_desc:0 "Blademarches has always been a landlocked country, with Lake Silvermere being the only notable body of water on our borders. In the aftermath of the Greentide, the routes across the lake have become important for commerce in the region, and it is up to us to decide how we want to react to that."

 B33_breadbasket_of_blademarches_title:0 "Breadbasket of Blademarches"
 B33_breadbasket_of_blademarches_desc:0 "The area surrounding Devaved has always been the most fertile part of our kingdom. The impassable mountain range of the Godshield protects our crops from harsh weather, and the vast plains provide ample space, compared to the untamed woodlands creeping out from the Deepwoods to the South. Accordingly, all of Blademarches is dependent on the exports of the region, which has in the past lead to many local powerholders believing they would be better off as their own country. Yet the Greentide has not spared Devaced, and many fields still lay barren. This presents risk, as our growing standing army depends on being fed more than ever, yet also opportunity: With the former powerholders driven from the lands, we could lend the lands to our retired veterans, thereby creating a loyal class of citizens protecting our food supply. The land such granted would revert to the state upon the holders death, providing incentive for the next generation to join our armies as well."

 B33_from_the_bottom_desc:0 "While heroic charges have won many a battle during the Greentide, it should seem that with the proliferation of the musket, their time has ended. Yet even the reformers among our generals disagree. They say that relying on massed volleys might be a valid tactic to compensate for the shortcomings of the halflings, but will ultimately devolve into a war of attrition, with countless casualties even on the winners side. While the individual heroism of ages past has no place in a modern army, they suggest that only releasing the volley at a few meters distance, followed by a coordinated and decisive charge, will quickly rout the enemy while preserving our forces. But to advance in the face of enemy fire will require nerves of steel. While it will make training more expensive, the new and absolutely relentless drill regimen will ensure that our soldiers stand firm under all circumstances."

 B33_developing_bladekeep_title:0 "Renovate Bladeskeep"
 B33_developing_bladekeep_desc:0 "The lands surrounding Castle Bladeskeep have always been the loyal core of our kingdom. Even in times when the Burghers of Vernham mumbled, the South was plagued by beasts and petty warlords, and Devaced openly declared independence, our loyal subjects here have stood firm. And yet, being one of our easternmost territories, it was also one of the first to fall to the Greentide, with the rest of the kingdom soon to follow. Castle Bladekeep is now no more than a ruin. This is unworthy of the Bladechosen - let us repopulate these lands, till the fields, see to it that the forges run hot, so that we may rebuild our ancient home!"

 B33_dragons_hoard_title:0 "The Dragons Hoard"
 B33_dragons_hoard_desc:0 "Recent developments in Geomancy have revealed a massive seam of gold below the lands of Dragonfell. Whether this is an ancient hoard of Alos the Copper, compressed by seismic activity, or a naturally occuring seam that might have attracted the dragon to the place where he was eventually slain in the first place, is a matter of ongoing debate. Nonetheless, it would at first appear that the gold lies far to deep to be exploited by the conventional mining techniques of our time. Yet some enterprising Dwarves have presented themselves before you, very eager to exploit that new seam. They prmise that with your blessing and a little bit of state funding, the gold could soon flow into your coffers."

While the path we have taken might be quite different from mainstream military doctrine across Cannor, the results are undeniable. Glory to the Grand Army of Blademarches!"

 B33_blademarcher_soldier_title:0 "Modernize Equipment"
 B33_blademarcher_soldier_desc:0 "When the adventurers fought against the Orcs, they turned up to the battlefield with whatever their captains handed them, their lords provided, they had inherited, or they had looted on a recent quest. While this sometimes resulted in moments of great heroism when somebody turned up with some ancient artifact, most often, it did not. This is no way to run a modern army. Let us standardize the eqipment of our soldiers and incorporate the newest innovations. Our armormarkers have made great strides in mass producing enchantments that make our armor lightweight yet durable enough to withstand standard shot. While the cost would still be prohibitive for a larger force, who would rather abandon armor altogether, our elite army will greatly benefit as it closes the gap. There, they shall fire their feared "bladed rounds". While useless at standard ranges, at close range, they will tear right through the enemy lines. Lastly, of course we will not abandon our cherished swords. While a bayonet might be the more versatile - and probably more importantly, cheaper - tool in the hands of an untrained soldier, every soldier of Blademarches is and will continue to study the blade."

 B33_army_reform_title:0 "Reforming the Army"
 B33_army_reform_desc:0 "Our army made a name for itself during the reconquest of Escann, and is seen an inspiration by many. Yet behind closed doors, your military advisors bring warning: At the moment, our army is carried more by fervor than by proper discipline. With the veterans retiring and the adventurers somewhat inexperienced and aimless when it comes to administrating rather than just fighting, not to mention a general lack of unified equipment standard, drill manual or system of recruitment, we might fall behind the times soon enough. In fact, the generals even suggest reducing the size of our army for the moment, suggesting that with our current limited resources, it would be easier to supply and reform a unified and elite set of troops. After all, what use there in introducing a new standard set of boots to the troops when half of them are still marching without any at all."

 B33_developing_the_kingdom_title:0 "Reclaiming the Marches"
 B33_developing_the_kingdom_desc:0 "Your economic advisors have welcomed the look inward, claiming there are many areas of the kingdom that could use your attention if they are to realize their full potential. They suggest a program of inviting settlers to come here, especially from among the more inventive races on the continent. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these are often the first to suffer religious, racial or simply political persecution, or may simply desire a different path in life than the rigid hierarchies common among their own kin allow. Any open minded ruler who offers them a new home would surely receive a great many capable artisans, entrepeneurs, with their unique expertise benefitting the kingdom greatly."

 B33_developing_vernham_title:0 "The Small Quarter"
 B33_developing_vernham_desc:0 "When what is now known as Old Vernham grew too crowded, the burghers of the city chose to erect a new city, which eventually became the cultural and commercial heart of the whole metropolitan area. Yet Vernham was hit particularly hard by the Greentide, being reduced to little more than ruins. In fact, with Old Vernham providing the more fertile lands and the recent re-establishment of its ironworking industry, Vernham has been lacking behind its older sister ever since. Yet properly presented, such a city may prove all the more attractive to the immigrants we invited, many of them who are artisans and would prefer to build new communities rather than be spread across a vast and foreign kingdom, far away from any of their kin. With the consent of the Burghers, we could designate a new district for the small folk where the normal building restrictions don't apply and surely they will come in droves."

 B33_vernham_gemcutting_title:0 "The Vernham Cut"
 B33_vernham_gemcutting_desc:0 "Innovation in the Blademarches has always been driven first and foremost by the needs of the military and accordingly, most manfacturing in our country has been of a rather practical nature. When Gnomish Artificers in Vernham recently attempted to develop a blade of unparalleled sharpness, the result at first seemed like a failure - a blade limited and size and getting dull after a few hours away from the charging station. After the initial disappointment, a dwarven craftsman tasked with repurposing the supposed scrap metal realized a new use: These blades were in fact sharp enough to cut through gemstones, including diamonds, as if they were butter! A passing Halfling entrepeneur, only having heard butter, quickly realized the potential: With such a tool and their established skill with blades, the craftsmen of Blademarches would be able to cheaply carve gems while not sacrificing any of the brilliance provided by more traditional methods. Thus, the famous Vernham Cut was born. "

 B33_forge_of_war_title:0 "Engine of War"
 B33_forge_of_war_desc:0 "Within our country, there has developed what has come to be called a military-industrial complex: the growing needs of the military drive demand, which the industry satisfies. There is little in this country not considered part of that complex - even the famous, once purely decorative gems cut in Vernham have become a vital component for many devices developed for our military by the artificers. Military, industry, one can clearly no longer exist without the other. To ensure that this precarious connection does not result in disaster, we should put certain safeguards in place that give the state a level of control over the industries it considers vital for national defence - in other words, all of them."

 B33_from_the_top_title:0 "Forming the General Staff"
 B33_from_the_top_desc:0 "Men and women of great charisma lead us into this land and continued to serve as the leaders of our armies afterwards. Yet no man is an island. Even Corin had her trusted circle. The ever increasing logistical and organizational demands of contemporary warfare threaten to overwhelm our generals, who might in turn be forced to cede some of their responsibilities to lower officers, who might not necessarily be qualified. Yet the recent institution of the Vernham curriculum within the School of the Blade offers us to opportunity to create a new generation of specialized officers to advise their superior in all aspects of war. While attaching this circle of officers to each of our generals will inevitably increase administrative costs, we can be sure that our generals will always stay focused on the larger strategic picture."

 B33_developing_dostans_way_desc:0 "Being the only route guarding us from the Gnolls of the Folly and the vile Corvurians, Dostan's Way has so far appeared a rather poor and bleak area. Yet recently, we've both been approached by both Dwarven and Gnomish entrepeneurs, claiming that through their respective expertise, they could turn it into the greatest mining hub of our kingdom. Competition is always good for business, so we have that rather than favor one or the other, we should grant both parties the rights to develop the area."

 B33_settling_the_east_title:0 "Settling the East"
 B33_settling_the_east_desc:0 "The provinces of Swapstoke and Medirleigh have in the past been known as the Eastern Marches. Bordering our old enemy in Marrhold, they have often served as a battleground, yet it was their position at the Crossroads of South Castanor that made them so desirable in the first place. Now that we control them again, there has been an influx of settlers from the rest of Blademarches, some of them yearning for the easier times after the Greentide, when a man could freely settle these lands and make their own luck. We will tolerate this "Wild East" for now, for we realize that in such autonomy lies opportunity, and one day, they will become as valuable a part of our kingdom as any."

 B33_interventionism_1_title:0 "A Questing Army"
 B33_interventionism_1_desc:0 "While many of the states formed by former Adventuring Companies quickly turned inwards or even towards squabbling among one another for the reclaimed lands, we never forgot Corins original mission: To cleanse the land of all evil, to reclaim Escann from the Greentide. Where others forgot and contented themselves with having their armies protect their petty kingdoms, we never faltered, and sent our mighty army to fight alongside whomever we judged just."

 B33_interventionism_2_title:0 "League of the Blade"
 B33_interventionism_2_desc:0 "As the growing conflict between the Adeanic and the Coronite denominations became apparent, the Bladechosen King invented all the Corinite lords friendly or allied to him to the city of Vernham. There, he proclaimed the foundation of the League of the Blade, an organization dedicated to leading a great Corinite Crusade, both against evil, and against all those who would oppress her loyal believers (who would thereby have proven themselves to be evil, one might say). From its foundation, the League was clearly dominated by Blademarches, expecting little in material or military contribution from anyone else, instead clearly attempting to legitimize its historical and ongoing intervention in various conflicts, and more importantly, the escalation of such. None dared question the true motivations of the Bladechosen King though, gladly welcoming the support of the renowned Blademarcher Army."

 B33_interventionism_3_title:0 "Blademarcher Interventionism"
 B33_interventionism_3_desc:0 "What started as a legacy of adventuring and then turned into a religious mission had to eventually become simple pragmatism. Even if Blademarches had decided to look inwards rather than build an empire, it was clear that in this age of continent-spanning conflicts, our kingdom would still have to assert its influence in all manners of international politics. With a history spanning all the way back to the Greentide, the Expeditionary Force of Blademarches is legendary and well-renowned for its size and played a decisive role in many a conflict across Cannor."

These lands have never been fully tamed, with many a beast, outlaw and now lost Greenskin warbands creeping around the thicket. In particular, the direct road from Blademarch Proper to Vernham going through the area known as the Clovenwood has never been truly safe, with merchants instead preferring to drive upriver, slow and arduous, yet with much less risk of getting torn apart by something with glowing eyes and claws lurking in the bush. This cannot longer stand. Let us patrol the roads, raise walls around the villages, and let all the beasts of the forest know that from now on, we are the hunters."

Yet there are never enough who would fight, and every loss cuts deep – especially those that could have been prevented.\nTo solve both of these problems, we will institute the ‘Lifetime Service Act’. All our subjects shall be conscripted for one standard lifetime – irrespective of gender or race. Our Elven subjects, who have many, shall at least spend one of them serving the military. One might even dream that so many adventurous youngsters of less than a century living side by side in the barracks might result in the occasional dalliance. The result of which would be a great embarrassment to civil Elven society, yet one the state would happily, discretely, maybe even lucratively, take off their hands.\nOur other subjects, who only have one lifetime to give, shall spend it as reservists. Happily laboring in service of the state, far from the battlefield for most of their life, but ready to be called upon for serving in supply, logistics and field hospitals. Or that wholly dishonorable military discipline: the artillery. The kind of job that is necessary, but does not require an elf."

They simply cannot hope to reach the level of experience that only many lifetimes of training in pursuit of the martial ideal bring. Obviously, such experience might matter little on the modern battlefield, where any stray cannonball fired by some freshly hatched goblin could end the life of a dozen ancient blade-masters. For that, humans will do just fine. Yet for leadership roles, such experience still remains invaluable, for any unit is only as effective as the officer in charge of it. By keeping our officers Elven and introducing new training regimens to adapt their famous hundred-year-drills to a somewhat more manageable timeframe, we may preserve at least a semblance of our races legendary prowess. Our human subjects might not be as eager to join the army if there is no chance of advancement to the higher ranks for them, but eventually they will realize that it is for the best."
