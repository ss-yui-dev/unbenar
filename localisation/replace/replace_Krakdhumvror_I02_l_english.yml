Moments ago [Root.Monarch.GetName] had simply walked into the room and rested, as instructed. The mages of the realm were pleased with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favor, and had agreed to perform this rite in secret, a rite heavily frowned upon in these mountains. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] knew death awaited one day, and would not allow the realm to falter. This was a necessity.

The High King presided over dozens of major holds, and countless minor ones. We ruled these mountains. And we may do so again. Unfortunately, with many Orcs having departed with Korgus Dookanson, other Dwarven states believe they are the ones destined to unite the Dwarovar. The Quartz Dwarves of Krakdhûmvror have no doubt we are destined to build a great empire built on the values of the Giant’s Anvil. However, we must first decide how we are to deal with the other Dwarves. The options are simple: Diplomacy or War."

 krakdhumvror.3.t:0 "The Goblin Question"
 krakdhumvror.3.d:0 "Goblins are grotesque creatures, small by even Dwarf standards. They are devious, clever, and just as greedy as Dwarves, if not more so. They have lived in these mountains since time immemorial, some say even longer than Dwarves. As ideas of tolerance and enlightenment spread to our upper and middle classes, many have begun to ask why we fight such creatures so similar in values to our own. Some Goblin clans, such as those of the Railskulker, have even retrofitted our technology into something of their own, showing some may have the ability to think beyond their next meal.\n\nOther, more traditional, Dwarves have called for the continued persecution of these beasts. We have fought them for generations for good reason. They are deceitful, ferocious, and often feral. Various clan leaders have pleaded their case before the crown. It is time we decide what place the Goblins have in our society."

If our ruler is merciful, they might be allowed an edict of forceful removal. Even still, we may provide the willing conquered a place in our armies as cannon fodder. At least then they might provide useful."

Their savagery and ruthlessness in combat rivals the Orcs we fight at home, but occasionally some Centaurs will remain in our realm, creating an uneasy coexistence that could snap at any moment. Many of our dwarven populations in the area are rightly worried about such arrangements and would prefer we remove them."

In ages past our first inhabitants were banished from the Empire and deliberately isolated from our southern brethren. The Dwarves of the Giant’s Anvil had little interest in the outside world, as the outside world had little interest in us. But the world has changed, so the hold must change with it. Proposed by Ugrim Thundersteel in 1467, the eponymous Thundersteel Commision was a coordinated effort by the Lords and Leaders of Krakdhûmvror to equip colonial expeditions to expand their influence over the entire Giant’s Anvil and Northern Pass regions. With it brought bureaucratic reforms to better record census information, categorize cartographic information, and to more rapidly integrate new lands into Krakdhûmvror’s central domain."

Their sordid hands were no doubt the cause of the corruption and immorality of the Old Dwarovar. Their claims of honor fall on deaf ears in Krakdhûmvror. We will not tolerate those who enslave, stratify, and suppress. We will take control of Haraz Orldhûm and burn every record of this vile hold, before returning it to the stone where it belongs."

Now the hold is occupied by those whom do not deserve the honor of possessing the Dwarovar’s great ancient capital, and we have ordained it our duty to liberate it. Adventurers from the Giant’s Anvil to Middle Dwarovar to even Escann signed up to participate in the liberation of the hold. We expected a swift victory with little casualties to our own armies. What we had not anticipated was the utter destruction of the hold. On the first day our artillery peppered the outer walls with heavy artillery fire. On the second day, soon after we had breached the walls, the hold was stormed under the personal command of our generals. Everything went as planned…until we broke through the inner walls. The scene that played out could only be described as horrific. It was as if every man became feral and descended upon the hold to feast. Whoever once called this hold home will never again."

They have kept the railyard in surprisingly operational order, much more than we expected from the greenskins. They have proven to be industrious, diligent, and enthusiastic when it comes to the various rail systems. We would be dishonest in saying Quartz Dwarves knew all the ins and outs of the Old Dwarovar rail system. As such it has been discussed at length what we wish to do with the Goblin workers who remain in Er-Natvir."

As exhausted Dwarves take their seats there was silence, an overwhelming sense of uncertainty amongst the noble crowd. The table before them was vast, meant to seat hundreds. Horns and drums fill the air as the last of the lords take their seats. [Root.Monarch.GetName] enters the hall, surrounded by Grim Legion clad in icy shields and sullen armor, their faces obscured by a cage of malachite. [Root.Monarch.GetName] enters holding the Crown of Amldihr, a crown bearing the weight of an empire. [Root.Monarch.GetName] walks to the end of the table, pierced by the eyes of hundreds of lords, and hands the crown to the court mage. The lords, expecting their lord to kneel and accept the crown of the Aul-Dwarov, are instead shocked when the mage casts a fire bright enough to shine the entire hall in its glow, melting the crown into a pile of gold and jewels on the floor. [Root.Monarch.GetName] sits on a seat no different from that of the other lords, and raises a goblet so plain you would think it unfinished. The Northern Lords immediately erupt in cheers and laughter, raising their goblets and drinking all their stomachs can handle. [Root.Monarch.GetName] lowers [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] goblet, expecting nothing less. This was a new age for the Dwarves of the North. An age not for vast empires dominated by far away kings in pursuit of greed, but of lords ruling their holds with enlightenment and benevolence. This was not the Old Dwarovar. This was a new empire, made from Quartz."

Every hold under our reign prospers, every rail restored, every field in the Serpent’s Vale aplenty, every mine in the West Serpentspine bursting with resources, and every citizen afforded the rights and freedoms they deserve. Krakdhûmvror surpasses even the old holds of Amldihr and Grônstunad and our reign is legitimized by the Ice Scepter and the favor of the North Lords. We have built an empire for the Dwarves and Beasts of the North, doing away with the decadence of the old. However, our people still divide themselves on arbitrary lines. It is high time we stop using the moniker of our homeland to rule our lands. We must proclaim a new empire, an empire of one, unified people."

 krakdhumvror.13.d:0 "As the isolation of Krakdhûmvror ended the rulers of the hold came to a stark realisation. Whilst they had long prided themselves on the meritocratic nature of their administration it was not without its faults. Talent, though rewarded, was rarely sought out and fostered, having instead relied on its citizens to come forward in times of need. In the eyes of the rulers of Krakdhûmvror this left far too much to chance, especially when it came to the defence of the hold.\n\nAs such in 1523 The Rite of Cold Iron, a rigorous examination that every dwarf seeking to join the military must take prior to being accepted, was created. This rite would later evolve into what was one of the first examples of a dedicated officer academy in all of Cannor, accepting any who had the aptitude to pass the rite."

 krakdhumvror.14.d:0 "Although it would never compare to Krakdhûmvror or any dwarven hold in the Serpentspine, Coking Hall had become a bustling city in its own right. As the final stop before the mountain range containing Krakdhûmvror Proper, Coking Hall has fashioned itself, through Inns, Industry, and however else, as a major component to our empire.\n\nBeing one of the largest non-hold cities in our empire, the Goblins of our realm often move here to find a place for themselves. They've proven to be capable of working hard and performing well, often for lower pay than their Dwarven counterparts. Up until now monstrous races have been barred from higher-skill jobs as long as they practice their ancestral shamanistic religion. Today the Burghers have come to us asking to repeal this edict, assuring [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] that it would increase profits. But our own ancient religion is a cornerstone of our society, and making an exception here would likely anger the prominent clergy in the city."
 krakdhumvror.14.a:0 "Religion should have no bearing on business. Repeal the restriction."
 krakdhumvror.14.b:0 "Our ancestors are of the utmost importance. They must convert if they wish for better wages."
 
 krakdhumvror.15.t:0 "Frozenforge Coup"
 krakdhumvror.15.d:0 "The Five Clans of Krakdhûmvror have sat in Krakdhûmvror Hold for centuries, doing little but enact conservative policy and squabble amongst themselves, but the world has continued to move around them, outside these safe walls. [Root.Monarch.GetName], of the Frozenforge clan has recently recieved disturbing reports, the orcs of the Serpentspine have invaded the overworld, toppling the human kingdoms and erecting kingdoms of their own west of the Northern Pass. To [Root.Monarch.GetName], the writing is on the wall. Krakdhûmvror must take action in claiming the areas surrounding the Giant's Anvil, even if that means seizing power for himself to see it happen. Clan Frozenforge is the current head of the clan council, and with the support of our forces, it would take lamentably little to overturn the entire government."

 frozenforge_crown_submod_desc:0 "When the Black Orcs left the mountains en masse to wage their crusade against the human kingdoms of East Cannor, the few Dwarven Holds who have fended for themselves for as long as any Dwarf can remember were left with a choice: to remain isolated and to continue living behind stone walls as they had for centuries, or to venture out into the dark caves of the Serpentspine, the former Dwarven Empire, and stake their claim on their homeland. In a near unanimous vote, the five clans of Krakdhûmvror had decided to remain in their walls. The only vote against was from Garlim of Clan Frozenforge. In response, in a brazen move, Garlim Frozenforge, followed by the ever-loyal Grim Legion, Frozenforge forces, and many Dwarves who were tired of the status-quo and formed their own militia, overran the hold’s central council building and were able to topple the other four clans in less than a day. For the foreseeable future, Krakdhûmvror would be ruled with a frozen fist. Only time will tell if Garlim and his ilk will lead the clan to fortune… or ruin."
