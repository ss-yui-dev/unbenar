 B33_attack_on_marrhold_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Marrhold was our Eastern neighbor for centuries and we were often at odds over the exact border between our two nations. \n\n They have defeated us before in cowardly ways, such as throwing Godwin the Stoutheart into Silvermere because they could not defeat him honorably. Yet during the Greentide, we have fought side by side with them to drive back the orcs. Whether we look for revenge or are ready to forgive, we will have to make a decision on how to deal with them."
