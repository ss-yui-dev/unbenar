 #Blade-Griffon Pact
 blademarches_submission_title:0 "Subjugating the Blademarch"
 blademarches_submission_desc:0 "The realms of Southern Castanor have always resisted the rightful authority of those who rule from Castonath. The soldiers of Blademarches, led by the Bladechosen Kings themselves, have been underestimated in the past - a grave mistake. Many would be invaders returned broken - and blind. Open conquest might not be the best course of action, and might in fact waste the military talents of their people. Let us instead demand their peaceful submission. We shall offer them autonomy in exchange for their military service."
 marrhold_submission_title:0 "Subjugating the Griffonmarch"
 marrhold_submission_desc:0 "The realms of Southern Castanor have always resisted the rightful authority of those who rule from Castonath. To set foot into Marrhold would invite death from above, as their legendary flying knights swoop down from the skies to drive out any who dare to approach the old Dwarven hold that now houses the Griffon Kings court. Open conquest might not be the best course of action, and might in fact waste the military talents of their people. Let us instead demand their peaceful submission. We shall offer them autonomy in exchange for their military service."
