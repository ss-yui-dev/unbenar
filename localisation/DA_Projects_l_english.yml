It is now possible to use have different part of one rune be used simultaneously by itself and an adiacent Rune.

 DA_project_event.113.d:0 "To be honest, it all started mostly as an accident in a common workshop and it happened many years ago. In the quiet confines of a workshop, a brilliant mind had stumbled upon a groundbreaking idea that could revolutionize our manufacturing processes: He noticed, while cooling the metal in water, that the air rising from the pot had a some kind of force, even if it was very little. After some failed experiments he managed to make that 'little' power lift a 100 kg block of steel from the ground. The man is now leading this project and we all hope to create something usable for the greater good."

 DA_project_event.119.d:0 "While we have found no practical uses for electricity, beside shocking some people, we have found an interesting byproduct: named Arcane Copper or ArCop, an alloy of damestear and copper, able to transfer both electricity and magical power from one place to another.
