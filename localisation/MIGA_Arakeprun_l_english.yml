 H01_custodians_of_the_precursors_2:0 "§PCustodians of the Precursor Legacy§!"
 H01_custodians_of_the_precursors_2_desc:0 "Arakeprun is a mighty and grand city built upon the bones of Precursors, with magnificent towers and sculptures that endure and inspire. However, its grandeur falls short upon closer inspection: it is mostly a shanty town of ramshackle buildings built upon the foundations of better elves. These ancient ruins are built with skills of architecture lost to time: it takes great effort and ingenuity to keep them maintained. Borne from the effort of repairing the Precursor legacy are skilled architects and engineers who reshape our city to be more grand, beautiful, and practical each day."
 H01_dawnfires_disciples_2:0 "§PDawnfire's Disciples§!"
 H01_dawnfires_disciples_2_desc:0 "During the Goldtree Rebellion of 1435-1440, Arakeprun was pushed back in defeat across the Arrag river by the Elchosi forces. Filnar Dawnfire, a talented and powerful Channeler of the Spring Court, rallied his comrades from the cities academies and pushed back the traitors with a terrifying display of raw magical power. Since then, Arakeprun has doubled its efforts to incorporate the magical arts in battle, with almost every few thousand men aided by a talented spellcaster."
 H01_vernal_expeditions_2:0 "§PVernal Expeditions§!"
 H01_vernal_expeditions_2_desc:0 "The act of exploration into ancient ruins is a sacred act for all of Eordand, not only the Selpheregi. However, none can claim the zeal of the Spring Court and foremost Arakeprun, uncovering relics lost to time and spreading the faith wherever they go. Aelantir contains uncountable mysterious and powerful artifacts: it is our purpose to discover them, understand them, and renew their power!"
 H01_grand_conservatory_2:0 "§PCourt of Everlasting Blossoms§!"
 H01_grand_conservatory_2_desc:0 "Spring is the season of regrowth, the regeneration of life after a long winter. Flowers bloom in every color of the rainbow in infinitely different shapes and sizes, birds and animals return with song and joy. Yearlong this most blessed of seasons endures in Arakeprun under the Court of Everlasting Blossoms, where thousands of plants and animals recovered from botanical and zoological expeditions bloom and prosper in an eternal Spring. Researchers also discovered the practical element of new crops for food, fuel, or other needs of society from this grand collection."
 H01_first_among_ruinborn_2:0 "§PFirst Among the Ruinborn§!"
 H01_first_among_ruinborn_2_desc:0 "Spring, above all is the season paramount. Unlike Winter or Summer the temperatures are not extreme, and unlike Fall it is the birth of life not the death. The Spring Court has grown, rebuilt in the ruins of Aelantir, unlike many of the others, squatting in tents and rubble. It is our duty to spread the rejuvenating warmth and rains of Spring to all of our fallen brethren."

 arakeprun_glorelthiran_ambitions_desc:0 "From Glorelthir to the Milsgelp sea, the land is rich in fruit and scattered with precusor sites. The goal of the Glorelthiran Guard is not only to defend our country, but also to take control the trade of the Glorelthir and the the flow of precusor relics."

 arakeprun_the_acadamy_of_arcane_sciences_title:0 "§TAcademy of Arcane Sciences§!"
 arakeprun_the_acadamy_of_arcane_sciences_desc:0 "As our exploration of the Precursor ruins deepens, our researchers have been greatly inspired and have proposed many groundbreaking blueprints for inventions. In ancient era, magic was just a part of people's daily lives, and Precusor creations brought magic into every home. Through our newest inventions, we might also catch a glimpse of the glory of ancient times.\nWe will build archaeological sites and academies at the ruins throughout Eordand. With the use of spring magic, we shall refresh and restore the power of Precursor Artifacts, and furthermore to revive our ancient splendor."
 
 arakeprun_academy_of_conjuration_and_meteorites_title:0 "§TConjuration and Meteorites§!"
 arakeprun_academy_of_conjuration_and_meteorites_desc:0 "Since Dawnfire' experiments succeeded, the mages within Arakeprun Academy have embarked on their own endeavors. Unfortunately, not everyone's capable of replicating the grand achievements of the Precursor Elves and summoning any Damestear meteors by themselves. But in this process, we've deepened our understanding of conjuration magic from the Precursor Elves. Here, a branch of the academy has been established, where mages utilize the facilities left behind by the Precursor Elves and exchange knowledge of conjuration. If some of them are fortunate, they might even summon small Damestear meteors or something else, making this place a coveted source of magical power for mages."
 
 arakeprun_contact_with_cannor_title:0 "§TContact with Cannor§!"
 arakeprun_contact_with_cannor_desc:0 "We have known that there are lands beyond our shores, mostly sparsely inhabited by primitive beings not blessed by our Fey Lords. The Caamasi also tell us of merchants from far to the south. What has arrived this day is not an ordinary occurrence: a massive wooden ship bedecked in gleaming iron guns sailed into our harbor, making inquiries about our lands and our peoples. Doubtless impressed by our culture, they wish to stay in our lands for some time. These Cannorians hold technological developments considered impressive by our standards, and the intermingling of the present races creates very interesting dynamics."
 
 arakeprun_between_spring_and_summer_title:0 "§TBetween Spring and Summer§!"
 arakeprun_between_spring_and_summer_desc:0 "Spring, the first of the seasons, is always inclusive and adaptable. Taking our relatives in Kairncal for example, their druids and clerics favor to channel the powers of Winds and Storms, overlapping powers between the Spring and Summer. As the Spring Court is united under our rule, scholars in both Arakeprun and Kairncal have recently launch a research project on interseasonal magic and navigation. With the assistance of The Spring Court, the art of Summer is poised to achieve true glory. After all, what is a Summer without the growth of spring? "
 
 arakeprun_march_on_the_waves_title:0 "§TMarch on the Waves§!"
 arakeprun_march_on_the_waves_desc:0 "The nobles in Dearktir, the inheritor of the ancient tyrant state, live a debauchery life. They are the tyrants of Sarmadfar, all who trespass into it may have their property confiscated. They possess vast reserves of Precusor relics, yet they only focus on the pleasure derived from these riches, disregarding the potential of social progress. If we wish to control the Sarmadfar trade and the flux of Precursor relics, they are our first primary enemy to take."
 
 arakeprun_seize_dorcurt_title:0 "§TSeize Dorcurt§!"
 arakeprun_seize_dorcurt_desc:0 "Dorcurt was once the beating heart of the Autumn Court, until the treacherous Iadth launched a sudden attack and sacked this place. Since then, the lords of autumn have been in constant dispute, each trying to prove themselves as the rightful heir of the Autumn Court. Iadth, on the other hand, have conspired with our rebel elements, the arrogant Goldtree of Elchos, in an attempt to weaken the influence of spring.\nIadth is like a dagger thrust into the heart of the Autumn Court. If we seize Dorcurt, we can eliminate this cunning enemy permanently but also expand our influence and solidify the Spring Court's rule in this region."
 
 arakeprun_foghar_under_arrag_2_title:0 "Foghar under Arrag"
 arakeprun_foghar_under_arrag_2_desc:0 "With the seizure of Dorcurt, the traditional seat of the Autumn Court is ours. However, the rest of the Tuathak lands are still held by the many Dukads and Scarbags. They must be made subservient to our Court on Dorcurt.\nThe Tuathak are a disciplined people, ever-preparing for the hardships of winter and war by gathering vast stores of supplies through organized labor. As a reward for their loyalty to us, we allow the Tuathak people to retain some of their traditional autumn customs and even encourage learning from them. Their way of life has proven beneficial to our military training."
 
 arakeprun_borders_of_winter_2_title:0 "Borders of Winter"
 arakeprun_borders_of_winter_2_desc:0 "The city of Darblath marks the traditional northern border of the Tuathak lands, and serves as a bulwark against the Snecboth forces of Winter. Unfortunately, their hold over the season is weak at best, and they have been unable to continue the Warmth rites. Our mages possess enough power to continue these magic rituals, even decipher their principles, and potentially enhance them. However, people of Darblath must pledge their loyalty to us first, sharing their ancient wisdom as well. In return, we will bring the warmth of spring to them."
 
 arakeprun_quell_the_blizzard_2_title:0 "Quell the Blizzard"
 arakeprun_quell_the_blizzard_2_desc:0 "In the far north of Eordand, the Snecboth dwell in cold and miserable lands.They ally with winter, using magic to survive the harsh season while bringing cold winds further south. The Tuathak despise their actions and launched the infamous Hibernal Crusade. This fanatical crusade brought much suffering to the land's inhabitants.\nNow, it is time for the people here to embrace the warmth of spring. We shall not allow them to use uncontrolled winter magic, yet we also cannot stand by and watch them suffer suspicion and the ravages of war simply for trying to survive in this harsh land. We will promote the use of Warmth Rites in this region, encouraging more nomadic Snecboth to settle down in warm wooden houses and to embrace the order of Spring Court."
 
 arakeprun_first_eordand_climate_symposium_title:0 "§TFirst Eordand Climate Symposium§!"
 arakeprun_first_eordand_climate_symposium_desc:0 "With the territories of the Tuathak and Snecboth now under our control, we have begun to address the long-standing animosity between these two groups. We have a example right before us: the Jhorgashirran. They were once part of the Hibernal Crusade, but after seizing the heart of the Winter Court, they gradually came to see the innocence of the Snecboth and developed a philosophy of coexistence.\nHowever, we are neither nobles nor warlords, neither Autumn Court nor Winter Court. We will resolve the conflict between autumn and winter in our own way. We shall gather scholars to collect the customs of Tuathak and Snecboth, especially those related to the magic of warm. Then, we will hold the First Eordand Climate Symposium in Jhorgacuith..."
 
 arakeprun_experimental_weaponry_title:0 "§TArtificers' Experimental Weaponry§!"
 arakeprun_experimental_weaponry_desc:0 "There'r many treasures lies in expedition sites, such as blueprints of a device called "firearm." It's documented that user can simly pull the trigger, then this "Firearm" will unleash lightning to engulf targets. Although the ancient technology of precusor elves has been lost, these blueprints still inspired our scholars to reverse engineering these objects in their own way.\nWhile our forces are equipped with a lot of battle mages for support, the use of artifice can provide us with greater firepower and a wider range of tactical options. For instance, there's the "Magic Missile" type firearms, which allow our troops to launch precise strikes from a considerable distance, though they are currently limited in charges and can only serve as secondary weapons. There's also the "Barrier Spell" type shield generators, which serve as defensive equipment capable of drawing a large amount of firepower for a short duration, highly effective in fortress warfare, but lacking mobility and flexibility. Despite the various flaws in these equipment, we do see the potential they have in the battlefield. Now, it's time to put them to the test..."

 arakeprun.2.t:0 "First Eordand Climate Symposium"
 arakeprun.2.d:0 "Jhorgacuith was once a dagger thrust into the heart of the Winter Court by the Autumn Court, armed into a steel bastion by a stubborn king. However, times have changed, and everything is now different. We have brought peace to this place：silk replace bronze, and curiosity replace zealous. At this moment, the First Eordand Climate Symposium has officially begun.\nScholars from Eighard were the first to take the stage. Their collaboration with us has been ongoing for a long time. The speaker detailed how their people had been ravaged by frigid winds and waves, and how their mages drew inspiration from the Autumn Court’s traditional magic to invent a series of Warmth Rites. He particularly thanked his colleagues from Arakeprun, as our combined efforts had simplified these rites into the hearthward. This is a creative invention that removed the dependence on priests or mages, allowing more people to enjoy convenient warmth.\nNext, a Snecboth scholar took the stage. Despite the time that has passed since the war, many Tuathak people still glared angrily at the Snecboth, though they refrained from acting out due to our presence. The Snecboth scholar looked around the room and clamly began her presentation. She described how her people sought a glimmer of hope during harsh winters and compared the differences between autumn and winter magic. She explained that while autumn magic attempts to resist, winter magic’s secret to combating cold is adaptation. Snecboth mages cannot create warmth or heat with their skills, but they can direct cold winds or make bodies more resilient to freezing temperatures. Many Tuathak scholars immediately raised their hands with questions, which the white-haired lady addressed one by one. They seemed eager to outdo each other with their words, trying to prove the superiority of their magic.\nFinally, an agricultural scholar from Jhorgashirr was invited to the stage. The Snecboth scholar’s topic was continued, but the focus shifted to agriculture rather than civilian heating. They explained that winter magic has a long history of use in Jhorgashirr, with practices proving that regulating soil temperature in winter benefits the next year's harvest. They shared numerous successful cases of cultivating frozen land, which left many Tuathak scholars deep in thought.\n\nThe symposium concluded amidst the clinking of glasses as everyone raised their cups and drank the fay wine. Scholars from all attending groups shared their histories and technologies, finding many commonalities in their efforts to combat the weather. Perhaps, in time, these amicable exchanges will bear abundant fruit."
