 DA_Orlazam_az_dihr_event.3.d:0 "After training the Rams for many years we have finally managed to subdue them, the only problem left now is: how should we use them?\nWe can add them to our cavalry as additional units, thus increasing our potential forcelimit and lightly enhancing our cavalry units.\n\nWe can integrate them in the Cavalry and partially substitute our Rams with the dark ones thus resulting in a substantially enhanced cavalry.\n\nThe last proposal, the most expensive one, suggests completely substituting our current Ram Cavalry wtih Dark Rams: this would reduce our potential force limit and cavalry fraction while exponentially increasing the costs BUT our cavalry would probably become a living nightmare for our enemies.\n"
