 MIGA_flavor_kobildzan.1.d:0 "Kobolds had tamed drakes well before their recorded history, but the sacred nature of the dragonlike beasts meant risking them in warfare was taboo for centuries. However, in the face of human and gnomish incursion, desperate circumstances forced their handlers to attempt using drakes as combat cavalry. Their sheer effectiveness on the field helped shake this taboo."
