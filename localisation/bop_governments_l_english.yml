 blademarches_republic_reform:0 "Bladechosen Republic"
 blademarches_republic_reform_desc:0 "While we have deposed the Bladechosen monarchy, there is no denying that there are those who are born to lead the nation, and to wield the blade - and those who are not. Nonetheless, while it is improbable for any individual commoner to rise to the top, it is possible, and solely based on merit - a powerful idea, driving all to new new heights of bravery."
 blademarches_theocracy_reform:0 "Strato-Theocratic Blade-Stewardship"
 blademarches_theocracy_reform_desc:0 "The Blademarches have always been a fief, granted by Calindal. Now, the blade shall take its land backs. As its chosen representative, the Order of Blade Stewards has now fully seized control of the state. The Grandmaster, now chosen by and holding Calindal in their own hands, serves not only as spiritual leader, but also and secular administrator of the realm and commander-in-chief of the Bladesworn. This personal union has enabled us to direct the resources of the state and zealotry of its people towards the blades cause like never before."
 bop_cannot_ally_tt:0 "Cannot form alliances with anyone"
 blademarches_royal_faction:0 "Royal Faction"
 blademarches_royal_faction_desc:0 "The Royal Faction has won the struggle for the Bladechosens attention. They want to focus our efforts on domestic matters, arguing that Blademarches strength comes from the traditional lands of the kingdom and its brave people."
 blademarches_imperial_faction:0 "Imperial Faction"
 blademarches_imperial_faction_desc:0 "The Imperial faction has the Bladechosens ear, and is pushing for a policy of opportunistic expansion. As they say, with the blessing of the blade and our mighty army, we are meant for more than a kingdom: we shall forge an empire."
 blademarches_royal_blademarcher_army:0 "Royal Blademarcher Army"
 blademarches_royal_blademarcher_army_desc:0 "The Blademarcher Army is a disciplined and professional force. By deciding to limit its size, our generals have been able to put more effort and resources into necessary army reforms. In time, it will become the greatest army that Cannor has ever seen." 
 blademarches_royal_bladesworn_army:0 "Bladesworn Army"
 blademarches_royal_bladesworn_army_desc:0 "The Bladesworn have always been a shining example to the rest of our army, never wavering even against overwhelming odds. With the Bladesworn under direct government control - and pay - we can avoid some of the irregularities in supply and financing they have suffered in the past. This has enabled us to standardize, expand, and modernize them, yet still attract ample volunteers through their famous reputation." 
 blademarches_royal_new_model_army:0 "New Model Army"
 blademarches_royal_new_model_army_desc:0 "The New Model not merely concerns our new standardized army, but all layers of society. While only the best will serve in our armies, every young Blademarcher is conscripted and put through basic training. This not only ensures an experienced reserve to draw from, it also creates a strong sense of patriotism, with those in the manufactories understanding their responsbility to their sisters and brothers at the front."  
 blademarches_royal_fallback_army:0 "Reformed Royal Blademarcher Army"
 blademarches_royal_fallback_army_desc:0 "Rather than give in to interservice rivalry within our military, we have decided to give equal attention to all branches. Our greatest strength is unity, for we are all Blademarchers!"
 blademarches_imperial_blademarcher_army:0 "Imperial Army of Blademarches"
 blademarches_imperial_blademarcher_army_desc:0 "One need not be a native Blademarcher to feel the fervor that only the true and righteous wielder of Calindal could inspire. Recruited from all across Escann, our brave soldiers march tirelessly to conquer an empire worthy of the blade."
 blademarches_ministry_of_war:0 "Ministry of War"
 blademarches_ministry_of_war_desc:0 "The Ministry of War is tasked with oversight of all military matters, which, seeing the importance of the military to our country, has effectively turned them into the most important and efficient part of our bureaucracy. Through their extensive and always up-to-date recruitment registers and their efforts to maintain vital infrastructure for supply and transport, they are very helpful when it comes to collecting taxes and tolls."
 blademarches_sword_of_corin:0 "Sword of Corin"
 blademarches_sword_of_corin_desc:0 "Many have embraced Corin's teachings, but a Blademarcher truly lives by them. Our driven spirit, our relentless pursuit of doing good and purging evil whereever it appears, are second to none. In a way, our kingdom has always followed her ways, even well before her ascension. We did not know, for we were blind, we had not yet basked in her radiant light. We wandered without purpose, until she has showed us a path that was always meant for us. We are her vanguard, her blazing sword against the darkness."
 blademarches_marcher_meritocracy:0 "Marcher Meritocracy"
 blademarches_marcher_meritocracy_desc:0 "The Marchers have always hed a strong belief in privilege that is earned, rather than given. Nowhere is this more apparent then in the tradition of the Bladechosen, who must prove worthy of Calindal, not merely inherit the throne. With the Greentide having destroyed the old power structures, and adventurers having built the new one, this has only become more pronounced. This does not mean that there are no traditional estates in Blademarches - but it has now become custom that rather than inherit those privileges, they have to be earned. The son of a noble might not necessarily become a noble himself if he proves incompetent, and a commoner who has proven himself worthy might rise to his rank instead."
 blademarches_council_of_blind_masters:0 "Council of Blind Masters"
 blademarches_council_of_blind_masters_desc:0 "When Calindal chooses an an elf as worthy, it does so for a long time. While we have to trust the blade, it is not unheard of for the long-lived races to fall to decadence with age, without even knowing it. For this reason, we have appointed the Blind Masters, those Blade Stewards who were once judged unworthy by the blade to our council. Humbled by their failure, they shall advise the Bladechosen, so that they might not repeat their mistakes."
 blademarches_thing:0 "Great Balgazor"
 blademarches_thing_desc:0 "Inspired by the orcish custom that centralized power is dependant on the loyalty of regional warlords and the human traditions of democracy going all the way back to the Damerian republic, Half-Orcish military keeps elect their own commanders. Those then meet in an assembly, the Great Balgazor, where they petition for privileges and supplies for their keeps. Since they are dependent on the support of the other keeps, this tends to result in a better distribution of supplies and less favouritism."
 blademarches_general_staff:0 "Great General Staff"
 blademarches_general_staff_desc:0 "The Great General Staff is an group of our highest ranking officers, advising the Bladechosen king on the newest military innovations, so our country might preserve its edge."

It has chosen their whole dynasty, a divine lineage of Bladechosen Kings and Queens, destined by the gods themselves to rule in perpetuity over all of Blademarches."
 blademarches_blade_servant:0 "Servant of the Blade"
 blademarches_blade_servant_desc:0 "Clarimonde was not granted §OCalindal§! by the Bladestewards, or even the gods. Only through hard work and bravery did she rise from a mere squire to queen of our kingdom. To deny such opportunity based on lineage would be folly, and so like all things in Blademarches, the blade should be distributed based on merit. With the kingdom itself the ultimate reward, no matter how far fetched, the people are more eager to serve than ever."
 blademarches_enlightened_monarchy:0 "Enlightened by the Blade"
 blademarches_enlightened_monarchy_desc:0 "Our rule is as §OCalindal§! itself - a shining example to our people. Nothing more and nothing less. It is the peoples duty to toil and pay their taxes, so the Bladechosen may serve their duty to protect them. Through their enlightened yet firm rule they lead Blademarches into a bright future."

 boost_bm_militarization_desc:0 "According to the theory of 'total war', all layers of society need to be mobilized to serve the war effort, for only a unified society dedicating all its resources can prevail within the devastating conflicts of our times. When war is inevitable, preparation is key. When every cog is necessary to drive the great war machine, to idle at works amounts to sabotage, to retreat in the field amounts to treason, to not show the proper patriotic fervour amounts to defeatism. Discipline in face of adversity is not merely a virtue of the soldier, but to be expected of every single Blademarcher."
