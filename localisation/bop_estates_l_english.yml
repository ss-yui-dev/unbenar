 bladestewards_estate_events.1.d:0 "The Order of Blade Stewards loyalty to the the Blademarches is above all suspicion. Not even their opponents would question it, or interpret their actions as driven by self-interest. That makes them no less happy about recent events though.\n\nAlready deeply embedded in our administration for some time, the Order of Blade Stewards has used their influence to oust all the others estates from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s court and ministries, proclaiming their intent to rid the country of corruption and protect [Root.Monarch.GetName] against all undue influence.\nWhile admirable in principle, they are clearly in over their heads. The Blade Stewards may be masters of serving the government and getting it what it needs, but their heavy handed approach makes them unsuitable for politicking, with the other estates predictably outraged at their actions. As they say, a country should not be run like a monastery of mendicants. Even the most absolut rule ultimately needs some wiggle room, and outlet, a niche of opportunity: a privilege that one fears the loss of, tying them to the crown. And the rule of the Blade Stewards leaves none.\n\nWith the [Root.GetClergyName] agitating against us, the [Root.GetNobilityName] in open revolt and the [Root.GetBurghersName] leaving the country in droves for lack of opportunities, we - or rather, the Blade Stewards - are effectively running a very tight, yet sinking ship."

Many who seek purpose in life and see little opportunity to find it due to lack of noble birth or inheritance find their cause with them, while idealistic benefactors, though not ready to abandon their riches entirely, still eagerly share them with the order. Through some recent charitable donations and inheritances, and a steady flow of patriotic recruits, the Order of Blade Stewards has seen its reach within the country increase."

 bladestewards_estate_events.4.t:0 "Decline of the Blade Stewards"
 bladestewards_estate_events.4.d:0 "The Order of Blade Stewards is, while remarkably stable, not immune to downturns. Their somewhat rigid nature and utter devotion to the state does not necessarily make them attractive to opportunistically minded youth, and they tend to prioritize the financial wellbeing of the state over that of the Order itself. And then, there is always some infighting, even if they hide it well. A recent streak of such misfortunes has led to a temporary decrease in the Orders reach."
 bladestewards_estate_events.4.a:0 "Concerning."
 bladestewards_estate_events.5.t:0 "The Bladesworn seek new purpose"
 bladestewards_estate_events.5.d:0 "With our country at peace, the Bladesworn grow restless, seeking new opportunities to showcase their martial brilliance and serve the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While some of your advisors have suggested that they should take up civilian jobs, a policy that could surely be beneficial with no downsides whatsoever, you and they alike have rejected such preposterous proposals. The Bladesworn are after all, fully dedicated to living and dying by in service of the blade and its chosen bearer.\n\nSome have suggested that they should support their Bladepriest brothers and sisters in providing alms to the poor, alleviating the devastation wrought by war. While not a martial exploit per se, this would be agreeable to them, for it is after all, one of the purposes of their order, even thought the [Root.GetClergyName] has never been particularly eager about it.\n\nAnother suggestion is to send them adventuring, clearing out bandits and monsters across the countryside and ensuring the safety of streets and commerce. The Bladesworn are eager to do it, and have pledged to return all rewards to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], only seeking the thrill of combat. As expected, the [Root.GetAdventurersName] do not welcome the competition, especially when they essentially do the job for free.\n\nFinally, there is the suggestion of letting thems serve directly and officially as a royal guard. The [Root.GetNobilityName] is of course not too eager to be at court with a highly elite force in direct command of their liege... for reasons."
 bladestewards_estate_events.5.a:0 "To wage war is bravery, but to help those suffering from it is true chivalry."

 bladestewards_estate_events.6.t:0 "The Bladesworn and the [Root.GetNobilityName]"
 bladestewards_estate_events.6.d:0 "Other states traditionally have to rely on the powerful landholders of the nobility to provide the necessary manpower and supplies for their armies. Even with central authority growing, traditional privileges and simple opportunities provided by noble birth tend to ensure that they will keep a high level of influence among the officer corps.\n\nNot so in Blademarches, where the Bladesworn provide a powerful counterbalance to the [Root.GetNobilityName], or as one might even argue, supplant them in this role. Inheritance laws also tends to disfavour the [Root.GetNobilityName] of Blademarches, with properties tending to get lost to the state or even mere commoners over generations, rather than grow.\n\nThis has in turn lead to the emergence of a trend especially among the lower ranks of the[Root.GetNobilityName], where at first, younger scions would join the Blade Stewards, forfeiting their inheritance, but now, even small landholders themelves will join the order, formally bequeathing their holdings to the Blade Stewards, in exchange for being allowed to manage them. Since the Blade Stewards are not sworn to celibacy like other religious orders, this results in quasi-dynastic tendencies within the order, where families will prefer to pass their estates on to their descendants and successors within the order and gain rank, renown and influence that would not have been possible otherwise - of course purely on merit.\n\nThe [Root.GetNobilityName] of are not happy about this state of affairs, arguing the the Order of Blade Stewards is attempting to supplant it through unfair privileges not afforded to them in equal measure. They demand that [Root.Monarch.GetName] puts an end to such bequeathings and passes a law that if one of noble birth joins the Blade Stewards, their properties revert to the nearest noble relative instead. The Blade Stewards obviously petition you against this course of action."

 bladestewards_estate_events.7.d_1:0 "The relation between the Blade Stewards and the [Root.GetClergyName] has always been fraught. While the Order of Blade Stewards is formally a Corinite order, it has never submitted to the will of the official interpretation of that faith as laid out by the [Root.GetClergyName], instead endorsing a syncretic belief system emphasizing Calindals role as an aspect of Corin and therefore her personal blessing upon the Bladechosen. An interpretation that is arguably less open to questioning the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName], and which has found many adherents among our subjects, who tend to identify heavily with the various folk beliefs and tales across the Blademarches surrounding the blade.\n\nThis has now resulted in open conflict within a small village on the outskirts of our realm, where after a charitable visit by Bladepriests, which was well-received by the poor and neglected people there, they stormed a local Corinite temple, desecrating it. Or, in their logic, rather re-secrating it. Observers speak of a rough-hewn idol, made in the image of [Root.Monarch.GetName], in addition to a crude imitation of Calindal made from local farming equipment. The [Root.GetClergyName] speak of blasphemy, demanding the Blade Stewards pay for the restoration of the temple, while the Blade Stewards in turn argue that the temple had already been abandoned, along with the spiritual needs of the villagers, with the [Root.GetClergyName] not setting a foot within the village for months. Instead, they petition [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to allow them to officially bless the shrine, and encourage the erection of more across the countryside."
 bladestewards_estate_events.7.d_2:0 "The relation between the Blade Stewards and the [Root.GetClergyName] has always been fraught. Even more so in face of the fact that the Order of Blade Stewards stubbornly sticks to its Corinite ways, which our country has long since abandoned. Endorsing a syncretic belief system emphasizing Calindals role as an aspect of Corin and therefore her personal blessing upon the Bladechosen, they have found backing among our subjects, who tend to identify heavily with the various folk beliefs and tales across the Blademarches surrounding the blade, and in turn, are quite receptive to the Corinite beliefs.\n\nThis has now resulted in open conflict within a stronghold of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith in our country, where Bladepriests have erected a shrine in honor of Corin and Calindal, in open defiance of the local authorities. The Order of Blade Stewards defend their actions, demanding a right to worship in peace. While they accept [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s [Root.Religion.GetName] religious beliefs, they argue that to them this is still Corins country."

One such individual has recently seen a rapid rise to the ranks, with a promotion to the very top of our military now due.\n\nTheir talent is not just limited to brave leadership in the field. They have also shown their competence in introducing new drill regimens and tactics that make their unit stand out even among the rest of the extremely disciplined Bladesworn. Such openness to new methods is a rare trait among the Bladesworn, who are normally known for slightly conservative tendencies. While not openly hostile to new technology, they rarely adapt it on their own volition, which makes this individual all the more remarkable.\n\nThere is little doubt that they will inevitably rise to an important position within Blademarches - the only question is, which?"

If put in charge, they will never once consider their personal profit or neglect their duties, for even if they do not agree with every action of [Root.Monarch.GetName], their loyalty to Blademarches itself is without question.\n\nThis in turn makes them take any trace of corruption by another as not just treason to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but also as a personal offence. And what their local chapterhouse in [event_target:corrupt_province] has uncovered is much more than a trace.\nIt seems that through years of coordinated collaboration, the [Root.GetClergyName] and [Root.GetBurghersName] have withheld vast amount of taxes, tariffs and tolls alike. And this would have stayed undiscovered, had not the local Blade Stewards, through their own actions in the area, became suspicious of official records. Secretly starting their own surveys, they found allegedly deserted villages teeming with undocumented taxpayers, buildings declared soup kitchens for the poor, yet clearly highly profitable taverns, as well as whole ring of unlicensed halfling 'adventurers' cashing in on fraudulent monster hunting contracts paid for by the state, sharing the profits with the local authorities that set them up in the first place.\n\nThe Blade Stewards are outraged by the sheer audacity, and demand that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] hands the whole province over to them, so they may reintroduce order.\nMeanwhile, the [Root.GetClergyName] and [Root.GetBurghersName] have approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] as well. They do not deny anything, instead offering to pay a sizable 'fine', not wanting to burden us with the whole hassle of setting up a transfer of territory, and that certain rowdy elements within it might not react well to such a change of ownership."

 bladestewards_estate_events.10.d:0 "The Blade Stewards are a true beacon of stability within the Blademarches, but even they are not without problems. One such problem is that their eagerness and talent in serving the state rarely translates into the managment of the order itself. While they have a vast set of holdings, those are often managed by administrators more concerned with providing for the state than sustainability and growth, relying on donations and inheritances for new assets to come in. In other words, the Blade Stewards are much more effective in extracting wealth, rather than building it.\n\nThis has now resulted in a rather embarassing situation where the order is close to bankruptcy, which has in turn led to various accusations between the Bladesworn and the Bladepriests who is at fault - the former for demanding too much shiny new armor, or the latter for mismanaging the orders assets. As the liege of the Order of Blade Stewards, its grandmaster has approached you, deeply embarassed by their failure, unable to decide between the only choices left to fill the gap in funding: either reduce the equipment standard of the Bladesworn for a while, making it possible to maintain them with the current funds, or keep the standard but reduce the various investments provided by the Bladepriests, including into the maintenance and support of the Bladesworn."

Providing alms to the poor and painting a bright picture of they normally find many eager recruits, hoping for a better life in the army of [Root.Monarch.GetName], where even the lowliest peasant might rise to the top - even if they most likely won't.\n\nThis time though, a combination of particularly distrustful subjects and what has admittedly been somewhat mixed messaging have lead to major unrest within [event_target:overzealous_province]. While the Bladpriests insist that their call of 'pick up the blade or be struck down by it' was not at all to be taken as a threat - instead metaphorically referring to the idea that one cannot escape war, for war will come to them; as well as a relating to a certain eschatological belief among the Bladepriests that upon death, Corin will await all with Calindal in hand, and strike those down who did not serve her to their fullest capabilities - yet the nuance of this theological argument was clearly lost on the peasants. Having cornered the Bladepriests in a local temple, they ask to be left alone in the future, which the Bladepriests obviously refuse to do. The situation is threating to escalate into open revolt against our rule."

A normal event for any other estate of the realm, but a rather brazen display for the Blade Stewards. Another brazen display is the great host of Bladesworn they have brought in 'support' of their demands, which they claim are for the 'protection' of [Root.Monarch.GetName] from the hostile and selfish interests of the other estates, who might otherwise try to stop them from acceding to the orders entirely reasonable demands.\n\nTheir demands are, due to the nature of the Blade Stewards, quite reasonable - they all concern their greater involvement in the running of the state. Meaning that should we refuse them, this would turn into what might be the most stupid revolt imaginable - one in favor of offering support to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], against the very same, for honor would prevent the Bladesworn commander from retreating if their demands are refused.\nShould we defeat them, the Blade Stewards would of course disavow them and still formally support the crown and blade - but even they are not above pettiness, and it might not be the best idea to get those who pay for our best troops on our bad side."
