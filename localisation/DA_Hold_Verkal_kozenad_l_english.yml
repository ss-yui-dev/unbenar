 DA_ADK_explore.203.t:0 "Rough Etchings"
 DA_ADK_explore.203.d:0 "Our exploration team has returned empty handed but they reported some peculiarities.\nWhile Surveying The Dig Level they came across several etchings on the walls, most of them were some kind of warning but most of them were illegible. They have translated what was readable and reported their content:\n'DO NOT ENTER!'\n'THE ORCS *** COMING'\n'THE KING IS ****!'\n'May *** gods have mercy on us...'"
 DA_ADK_explore.203.a:0 "Orcs? king? what happened in this hold?"

 DA_ADK_explore.204.d:0 "Our exploration team has returned, collapsing the tunnels they came from to escape what they claim is just the vanguard of a an undead horde, some of which has managed to make it through before the collapse.\nThe presence of undeads in the depths of a Dwarven Hold has worrying implications, but defeating the incoming menace comes first"

 DA_Verkal_Kozenad_event.1.t:0 "Lingernig Menace"
 DA_Verkal_Kozenad_event.1.d:0 "We managed to defeat the undead horde but we have received confusing reports from the battlefield.\n It seems most of the undeads were dwarves, orcs and goblins being a minority. The bodies are extremely decayed, which hints at the age of the corpses. They may even date back to the Last Days of the Dwarovar. Should it be so, the number of animated bodies in the depth would be terrifying. Even more alarming, we have received reports from battlefield commanders insisting that the undead did not behave like a disorganized horde, but instead moved and fought in formations.\nWe have secured the Hold for now but the undead menace is still strong. We need to understand what happened here to solve the situation and the only way to do so is to keep exploring the depths"

 DA_ADK_explore.205.a:0 "It must be done"

 DA_Verkal_Kozenad_event.2.t:0 "The Chained Palace"
 DA_Verkal_Kozenad_event.2.d:0 "After defeating the undeads we recovered some of the territory they occupied and we finally understood.\nAfter carefully sorting out various etchings and ancient journals we found along the way, we have deduced what transpired in this Hold.\nDuring the ancient time of Aul-Dwarov, while the various Holds were holding back the orcish invasion unleashed by our archenemy, the precursor elf Ducaniel, from Hul-Jorkad, Verkal Kozenad's King, Mufnir VII, made a pact with Ducaniel.\nIf Ducaniel spared his hold, he would surrender to him and provide supplies as he marched on Er-Natvir. This, however, was a deception to open Ducaniel's back to an attack. Mufnir VII sent an army to relieve the siege of Er-Natvir, but they were defeated. The Hold was scoured of life shortly after by an orcish army. Ducaniel cursed Mufnir VII with lichdom and madness at the beginning of the attack, which broke the back of the defenders and hastened the doom of the hold. The King's guard managed at great cost to seal Mufnir VII in what they call the Chained Palace. The survivors perished shortly after, from their wounds or to orcish weapons. It seems the wards holding Mufnir VII have waned, or they may not have been strong enough in the first place, and the necromantic will of the lich has spread through the hold and grasped the many dead that lay there. We have reached the palace, but only a powerful mage can hope to face off against the maddened lich and free him of his torment. We hope your highness will find a way to see this problem to its end."

 DA_ADK_explore.206.d:0 "As we explore the deepest place ever reached by the opal dwarfs a strange sight awaits us there.\nSeveral ethereal figures approach us from afar and our exploration team grows anxious.\nAround 150 meters from us we hear a voice:\n''Do not fear us, brothers. We have no ill intent. We are the renmants of the opal dwarfs. To be precise we are the mages who sealed the Cursed King in his palace many years ago''\nAnother soul steps up and says ''We discarded our physical bodies many years ago to escape the orcish invasion and we lost most of our power while doing so. We had but one regret left, not managing to kill what was once our king.''\n...But this does not seem to be an issue anymore. His whispers have been quieted. Were you the ones who ended his unlife?'\nThe exploration team captain steps up and explains the past events with detail. After 2 hours of discussion the ghosts says:'We thank you for avenging our brothers and sisters. We no longer have material properties which could help you but our knowledge would probably be useful to your nation and we wish to help you'"
