 DA_ADK_explore.214.t:0 "Balgar, the Builder,'s Home"
 DA_ADK_explore.214.d:0 "Our Exploratiion Team has found a workshop with a very strange design.\nWe found a dwarven statue saying ''This is Balgar, The Builder,'s Home: exiled from his hometown due to the practice of worshipping old Gods instead of our ancestors. Having said this, he was anyway the greatest builder and made many contributions to the hold and the world during his lifetime. This home will be left for future generations to be inspired and pursue greater heights.''\nWe then entered the house and what was inside left us speechless: many statues representing the old Gods of the Dwarven Pantheon, positioned to enhance their majesty and beauty. It appears Balgar didn't like to do little things, he always pursued the greatest of projects. Going deep inside the house we came across a locked room. After forcing it open we found his studio and many unbelievable things: in this room lies most of his lifetime projects' blueprints, in all their majesty, and many others which we believe he never had the time to complete in his lifetime. For example, it appears he had planned an enhancement plan for his hometown, Khugdihr, and even the current Castonath is but a mere foundation for his true project...."

 DA_ADK_explore.215.t:0 "Beast in the Depth?"
 DA_ADK_explore.215.d:0 "While going deeper inside the hold's structure we came across a very complicated cave system which is more like a labirinth than anything else and, in many of these caves we found traces of a very ferocious beast. Its claws' marks are left everywhere on the caves' walls and they are massive. Bugbears are not strong or big enough to do anything similar to this and possible candidates do not even amount to 5. One old dwarf in the expedition hypothesised it could even be a dragon. While that is unilkely, it is still plausible, considering the fact that these depths were once home to Nimrith, the Red, a truly vicious dragon which terrorized Escann many years ago but was killed around 450-550 years ago by adventurers."

 DA_ADK_explore.216.d:0 "Some screams and screeches can be hears from the depths. After some time a small part of the exploration team rushes out from the caves while screaming their lungs out: ''It is Coming!! hide yourselves!!''\nSuddenly the earth trembles and an enourmous beast emerges from the darkness and rips some adventurers apart with its claws and then spreads its wings in the open space. Truly a majestic and terrifying sight: a ferocious red Dragon. It wrecked havoc for an entire day before retiring in what we, at this point, think is its lair.\nDuring the emergency council held afterwards it was hypothesised the dragon is the offspring of Nimrith, the Red, which hatched after its parent's death. As a dragon is an unbelievable enemy to defeat for a mortal it was suggested that a powerful great mage should be able to take care of it...\nEveryone looks at you in awkwardness"

Now that both Khugdihr and the project are in our hands it would be a fool's decision not to implement it."

He had never seen the Vale in his life so we can only take these notes as something he came up with after reading history and geography books.\nThe design captivated our architects but it was very rough so we spent some time to make it a plausible reality.\nNow we are proud to say the project is ready."
