 bop_flavor.0.t:0 "The Battle of Vernham"
 bop_flavor.0.d:0 "Calindal is not lost!\n\n Even as we bury our dead from the recent battle with a scouting party of the Bladebreaker Clan, there is little time to mourn. The only thought on everybodies mind is what was recently revealed by some liberated Half-Orcish prisoners: Varok Bladebreaker did in fact not break Calindal, the Gleaming Blade. The Blade Stewards safely whisked it away in time, as they did so many times before. Now in hiding, it is unlikely that they will emerge before a lasting order is reestablished in the region.\nThe news have lead to a veritable leadership crisis within the Stalwart Band.\nThe multi-racial band of adventurers has long been dominated by the human Busilari, though there are sizable contingents of other races.\n\n Captain Urion Davmor, ever the cynic, has so far shown little understanding for the sudden enthusiasm, arguing that the company should focus on its immediate needs and organizational issues rather than the hunt for some blade. His nonchalant attitude has done little to bridge the gap with other factions. \n \n The ever reclusive Elven part of the company has rallied around their leader, Celador Whiteblade. A Veteran of the Lilac Wars, a skilled orator and rare third son of a minor Ibevarian house, he is putting forth the idea of reclaiming Calindal for the Elves. \n \n On the other hand, the competing claim put forth by the Half-Orc Sandur of Oldhaven, that he is a distant relative of Clarimonde, who restored Blademarches after the War of the Sorcerer King, is highly questionable. Yet his strength in battle has earned him the admiration of his fellow Half-Orcs, and so he ultimately argues that the blade should simply go to the strongest. \n \n As the discussions turn into shouting and the shouting turns into a brawl, the three leaders decide to settle the issue before the brawl turns bloody. As the dust settles, the new leader of the Stalwart Band emerges, while the others leave the company, becoming lost to history."
 bop_flavor.0.a:0 "With the non-humans gone, lets focus on the real issue: Who's digging the latrine?"

 bop_flavor.1.t:0 "Imperial and Royal Blademarches"
 bop_flavor.1.d:0 "During the last few years, with everyone united in fighting for the the re-unification of Blademarches, there has been a period of remarkable political stability and consensus within the kingdom. With the kingdom reunited, and everyone looking for new purpose and opportunities, this tentative peace seems to have come to an end. Within recent weeks, two competing factions have emerged at our court. These have been named the Imperial and the Royal faction. As their names suggest, neither of them would dare question your rule itself, they merely disagree on the way forward. \n \n The Imperial faction is mostly made up of young noble officers and some former adventurers. They argue that our successful reconquest of Blademarches has proven that our army is unbeatable, and that to continue this conquest, to end the Greentide, should be our priority. In fact, they even want to make the other petty kingdoms of Escann submit to us, claiming that disunity was what led Chivalric Escann to fall in the first place, and only we, ruling over all of Escann, would be strong enough to prevent another catastrophe. They say that we should not be content to rule over a kingdom, when we could lead an empire. \n \n The Royal faction is popular with the Burghers, but also includes, somewhat counter-intuitively, both very conservative and very progressive elements of the military. The Burghers mostly argue that the devastation of the Greentide is great and so, there is still much to be done to rebuild the kingdom itself. War is rarely beneficial for the economy, so their position is understandable. \n Yet the military members of the faction offer another perspective. They caution that whenever one of the Bladechosen set forth to conquer foreign lands, it ended in disaster, and that every great empire that once ruled these lands inevitably fell. To grow fat is to grow complacent, and as history shows us, each great empire that considered itself invincible will eventually fall to an unexpected opponent, a nimble outside force, bringing a new way of war, felling the engorged giant before it can adapt. They say that to survive, we have to focus on rebuilding, and on innovating, predicting an age of great military upheavals where the armies conquering the world today, too busy to adapt to these new realities, could quickly be crushed tomorrow. \n \n The Imperials accuse the Royals of treason against both you personally and the kingdom itself for such suggestions, which the Royals of course vehemently deny, With each faction desperately vying for royal attention, the disagreement threatens to become violent. To favour one faction over another will define the future path of Blademarches."
 bop_flavor.1.a:0 "The Imperials are right - our might shall forge an empire!"
 BOP_IMPERIAL_PATH:0 "If you follow the Imperial Path, you will form a mighty empire stretching all across Escann and the Deepwoods."
 bop_flavor.1.b:0 "The Royals are right - our strength lies within the kingdom."
 BOP_ROYAL_PATH:0 "If you follow the Royal Path, you will focus on the core territories of Blademarches within South Castanor, developing the economy, reforming the army and sending Condottieri to fight in foreign lands."
 bop_flavor.2.t:0 "Return of the Marchers"
 bop_flavor.2.d:0 "Ever since we re-established the Kingdom of Blademarches, a steady trickle of Marcher refugees has entered our domain. Many of them are of a new generation that has only ever heard of their "homeland" in tales, yet the cultural ties remain strong. \n \n Now that we have restored stability in the region, we suddenly find ourselves confronted with a particularly large host of human immigrants that has swept across our country, not entirely unlike the Greentide years before. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] has been caught somewhat unaware by this and with the army occupied elsewhere, the refugees have settled in an uncontrolled and unsanctioned manner. While they are not outright hostile to our administration yet, Blademarches has historically been a human kingdom, and so even with backing of Calindal, the Gleaming Blade, there are those who would question our rule, if only in whispers. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] steps before the troops and makes [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] announcement:"
 bop_flavor.2.a:0 "Just garrison their villages and start collecting taxes."
 BOP_MARCHER_FLAVOR_HALF_ORC:0 "Leave them be, one day their children will just be Half-Orcs like us. \n \n Most of the Eastern part of the kingdom becomes §YHalf-Orc§!, while the §YMarchers§! settle the West."

 BOP_MARCHER_FLAVOR_ELF_SUPREMACY:0 "Blademarches will a new homeland for the Elves, and only the Elves. Burn their villages to the ground!"
 bop_flavor.2.c:0 "Elves will rule over humans. As it should be."
 BOP_MARCHER_FLAVOR_ELF_ACCEPTING:0 "They're doing it in Bulwar and they're doing fine. They're doing fine, right? \n \n Major cities will stay §Y[Root.Culture]§! while most of the country will convert to §YMarcher§! culture."
 bop_flavor.2.dd:0 "We will stand down and hand the kingdom back to the humans."
 BOP_MARCHER_FLAVOR_SURRENDER:0 "We're getting bored of ruling, and to be entirely honest, this whole overused blade motif is getting tiresome. \n \n Our primary culture will become §YMarcher§! and a new human dynasty will take the throne."

 bop_flavor.4.t:0 "The Silvermere Fleet"
 bop_flavor.4.d:0 "For all of its history, Blademarches has been a landlocked country, with the only body of water nearby being Lake Silvermere. With our connection to the lake restored and commerce in the area booming, there is the question whether we should launch a small squadron of ships of our own. While such a fleet would be irrelevant in war, protecting shipping lanes from smugglers, malevolent wreckers and the occasional inconceivable horror from the depths would certainly benefit trade in the region, while local and foreign nobility would certainly enjoy the occasional lake party. \n On the other hand, we could choose to forsake our naval ambitions altogether, leaving shipping across the lake to others. While our Merchants will not be happy, the Ministry of War has already suggested another project that could use the funds we would save."
 bop_flavor.4.a:0 "Even our army needs money, and commerce brings coin."
 bop_flavor.4.b:0 "Actual walls will be our wooden wall."
 bop_flavor.4.c:0 "Less wood for ships, more for siege engines."
 bop_flavor.4.dd:0 "It pains us to abandon the memory of the Remnant Fleet, but we must focus."
 bop_flavor.5.t:0 "The Great Military Review of [GetYear]"
 bop_flavor.5.d:0 "There march a hundred thousand soldiers, clad in gleaming armor, blades at their side that one might mistake for Calindal itself.\nBehind the common soldiers, there march the Bladesworn, the pride of our army, the very example by which we built it up. While much of their once distinctive equipment has become standard issue, they still carry that flicker of grim determination in their eyes that sets them apart from the common soldier.\n\nNow, all on white horses, follow those who lead them - the great generals of the kingdom, accompanied by their staff. They have pushed the soldiers hard, yet there is no animosity, for those at the bottom know that those at the top are only hard so that no life might be thrown away in vain, so they may fight for Blademarches again another day, so they may go home to their family one day.\n\nThen, there come the artillerymen. They are also here.\n\nFinally, there are the Bright Hussars. Let the rest of Cannor hide behind their walls thunder and smoke, let them neglect their cavalry - let's see how they can fire when they cannot see. One day, their fearless charge might be their undoing, but today is not that day. \n \n You step upon the simple wooden plattform hastily erected in those fields - this is after all, a military review, not the petty parade of some despot trying to create an illusion of might. Your power, your divine right to rule, is right there at your side.\n\nAs you lift Calindal to the sky, all fall silent, averting their eyes for the moment - then a mighty hooray echoes across the fields.\n\nThis truly is the greatest army in all of Cannor, if not to world, and on this day, all the world is blinded it.\n\nIf only you weren't deafened by that constant bickering coming from behind you."
 bop_flavor.5.a:0 "Who here rains on my parade? I hope it's not that damn Astromancer again!"
 bop_flavor.6.t:0 "The Fate of the Bladesworn"
 bop_flavor.6.d:0 "The origins of the debate you witess in this tent before you reach back far.\nThroughout the years, the [Root.GetNobilityName] of Blademarches have seen themselves increasingly marginalized by land reforms and the growing importance of the Bladesworn within the military. Young noble officers now feel relegated to the less traditionally valued branches, and lacking opportunities for adancement within the hierarchy, many of them have become radical reformists.\n\nOne such young firebrand from the department of Artillery and War Artificery now stands before you. It is the department where careers normally go to die, and yet he has risen through the ranks quickly, all the way into your inner circle. His most radical theory, yet popular among fellow reformers, is that of "total war". He predicts that through new developments in Artificery and mass mobilization, only a nation fully dedicated to war will win it. He proposes a policy militarization and national propaganda, so that that all may serve what he calls "the great war machine".\nSo far regarded as a theoretical curiousity, his his latest proposal has ruffled some feathers. He calls the Bladesworn a privileged clique within the military, forcing the government into an unreliable - and costly - cooperation with the Order of Blade Stewards. He argues that the funds would be better used for his "New Model Army".\n\nThe commander of the Bladesworn is furious, yet far too clever to show it. She calmly admits the failings of the Order of Bladestewards - while it once pushed for the professionalization of the army, it has become somewhat of a reactionary force, and its financial managment of the Bladesworn is often lackluster. But she proposes another course of action: Rather then dissolve the Bladesworn, fully transfer them to the state. By essentially becoming the army, rather than being part of it, personal redundancies could also be eliminated - such as a completely useless, separate department for Artillery and War Artificery.\nWhile there would still be some additional costs to shoulder, direct control would also ease standardization, expansion and modernization of the Bladesworn.\nThe masses are already properly mobilized and inspired by the proud example of the Bladesworn, the commander argues, and so she asks, is it not a shame that so many brave citizens would gladly serve as Bladesworn, yet should be lowered to the level of a cog within the war machine?\n\nBoth of those proposals are also blatant political power grabs of course. But can you let such petty concerns guide you when the future of the army is at stake?"
 bop_flavor.6.b:0 "It is time for the Bladesworn to retire and for us to follow a new path."
 bop_flavor.6.a:0 "The Bladesworn have proven their worth. No experiments."
 bop_flavor.6.c:0 "Actually, I will let those petty concerns guide me. No more reforms."
 #BOP_ARMY_FALLBACK:0 "Those two will have to get along, and the funds will go to the Blazing Hussars instead."
 BOP_ARMY_FALLBACK_EXPL:0 "(This is the only option available to you due to not owning the Domination DLC. Alas.)"
 bop_flavor.7.t:0 "An Apparition on the Silvermere"
 bop_flavor.7.d:0 "At night, at the edge of the Silvermere in the city of Merenham, after a long day of examining the local barracks, hearing the Burghers petition and finally receiving your blessing by the Blade Priests at the grand cathedral, you allow yourself a moment of respite. Even the Bladechosen has responsibilities beyond fighting, and every day is a battle on its own no matter what. \n You stare into your reflection in the lake, and of Calindal besides you. As your thought drifts away, suddenly... the blade lifts. Or rather, it reflection does. Your eyes slowly follow, they hit the alabaster white feet of a woman, seemingly hovering above the water, you follow it upwards, you see armor, then, finally, a face, the face of an angel, framed by a mane burning bright as fire... Can it be? \n \n Corin. \n \n Before her, she holds Calindal, and for a moment, you do not know which of them shines brighter. \n Finally, she speaks, presenting your blade to you again. \n \n Blessed be thy blade, \n which has chosen you, \n as I have chosen you, \n as thou art my champion. \n Thou shalt purge these lands in my name, \n of all that is evil and unjust. \n Thus I command thee, \n oh champion mine. \n \n You blink, and the figure is gone, as suddenly as it appeared. Besides you lies Calindal, radiant as ever... if maybe ever so slightly more?"
 bop_flavor.7.a:0 "Could this truly have been the Lady of War herself?"
 BOP_SEIZE_LAKELADY_MONEY:0 "Seize the money for the army before the clerics get any stupid ideas."
 BOP_LAKELADY_PRIVILEGE:0 "A new privilege for the Bladestewards will be unlocked."
 bop_flavor.8.t:0 "The Orcs of Outmerewood"
 bop_flavor.8.d:0 "The forest of Oudmerwood, while not as dangerous as the Clovenwood once was, is known as one the last great holdouts of tribal Orcs in the area, who precariously preserve their autonomy by trading the furs of rare beasts they catch in the forests with local traders. They are undeniably good hunters, and should we agree to formalize this relationship further, we would no doubt benefit. "
 bop_flavor.8.a:0 "The only good Orc is an enslaved Orc."
 BOP_ENSLAVE_ORCS_HALF_ORC:0 "It will be hard to explain to your people why one half of their parents can be treated as property."
 bop_flavor.8.b:0 "They will become loyal in time. For now, it's enough if they're profitable."
 bop_flavor.8.c:0 "So, uh, bites lip, you've ever been with a human before?"
 bop_flavor.9.t:0 "A Visit by Tonker & Truebellow"
 bop_flavor.9.d:0 "As you prepare to sign the papers formalizing the new relationship between the state and the economy - namely, that the latter will from now on control the former - you receive message that Tonker & Truebellow are requesting an audience. Before you, you see a dwarf and a gnome who have clearly entered final decade even of their considerable lifespan. And yet, as you look into their eyes, you see the same fire, the same cleverness that has brought them this far, their minds clearly as sharp as ever. \n While you expect them to express their dissatisfaction with your latest decree, they do in fact praise your intentions to secure the economy, yet suggest another path. \n They tell you that they, as the leader of the oldest and most respected company within our country, understand its needs better than anyone, and would be happy to serve it well into the future. Or rather, have their sons and daughters, soon to inherit the company, do so. They ask you to merge all the seized assets into Tonker & Truebellow, which will be co-owned by them and the state in a more or less equal partnership. \n They have already brought the necessary papers. \n \n To understand all the intricacies of the deal, based on both Gnomish and Dwarven contract law, would take a lifetime - of a dwarf, or gnome. Possibly both. What is obvious though is that this would result in far less direct control of the economy than originally planned. That said, these two have undeniably served this state well, the industry we are now trying to seize essentially having been built by them. They know its ins and outs, and whether some bureaucrat in the newly created Ministry of Supply Security would ever fully comprehend its intricacies as these two do, is questionable. \n \n As you look at the papers before you, you ponder which one to sign."
 bop_flavor.9.a:0 "There is no reason to doubt Tonker & Truebellows loyalty, nor their invaluable expertise."
 BOP_ARTIFICER_CHOICE_TONKER_AND_TRUEBELLOW:0 "As a thank you, Tonker is offering you his great-grandchild as an apprentice."

 BOP_ARTIFICER_CHOICE_STATE:0 "Tonker & Truebellow will leave the kingdom, taking their talents elsewhere."
 bop_flavor.10.t:0 "The Question of Orcish Slavery"
 bop_flavor.10.d:0 "As we set out to develop our lands, we are confronted with many areas where sizable populations of remaining Orcish warbands remain. Some of these merely try to survive, while others threaten the surrounding areas through banditry. It has become common all across Escann to enslave Orcs, so that they and their descendants might work off the damages wrought by the Greentide, whether by serving us, or through the money gained by selling them. There are some who disagree with this, arguing that no sentient being deserves to be enslaved by another. We will have to make a decision what to do with those Orcs in our lands."
 bop_flavor.10.a:0 "Enslave them, the slave trade shall surely be profitable forever."
 bop_flavor.10.b:0 "We might purge them eventually, but I draw the line at slavery."
 BOP_ENSLAVE_ORCS_EFFECT:0 "Future missions will add the Slaves trade good to provinces."
 bop_flavor.11.t:0 "A New Workshop"
 bop_flavor.11.d:0 "Your plan to offer prospecting rights in Dostans Way to both the Dwarves and the Gnomes seems to have borne fruit - after some initial discontent particularly on the dwarves side, the whole thing seems to have quickly devolved into a friendly rivalry, with the Gnomes eager to outdo the dwarves with ever more efficient mining equipment, while the Dwarves are determined to show the Gnomes that the old ways are still the best. \n While the two races have mostly kept to themselves, a most peculiar story has been reported: \n Recently, a dwarf by the name of Hjalmar Truebellow and a gnome by the name of Ienkin Tonker have even formed a partnership and opened a jointly run workshop. Both are still young, especially by their races standards, and so far the workshop seems to have mostly produced a lot of smoke and a few broken windows in the neighbourhood, but it is an inspiring story nonetheless."
 bop_flavor.11.a:0 "A dwarf and a gnome working together! How quaint!"
 bop_flavor.12.t:0 "The First Factory"
 bop_flavor.12.d:0 "With the recent economic boom in the region of Dostan's Way, it was only a matter of time until the first factory would spring up, and so it did.\nWhat is most surprising though is that the owners of this factory are none other than Truebellow and Krobboo, the dwarf and gnome who once opened the first joint workshop among the two races in the country. They have grown older, yet this seems to not have hampered their drive. While many such workshops have since then opened up - and just as many closed over personal differences - it seems the two have been the most successful, having built their tiny workshop into quite the impressive venture. Now, members of all races present in our kingdom are indeed working side by side in this new factory, building the future of Blademarches. A true success story!"
 bop_flavor.12.a:0 "A surprise for sure, but a welcome one."
 bop_flavor.13.t:0 "The Cult of the Lady of the Lake"
 bop_flavor.13.d:0 "Retelling your vision in the following days, most of your close religious advisors are skeptical, arguing that apparitions such as this do not fit any of our concept of the gods. One of them points out that Corins supposed message is worded in a way not matching any historical record, but weirdly fitting the style certain novelettes of questionable quality and character inspired by those times. Another questions why Corin would wear armor but no shoes. They suggest the action of a malicious fey, or even some practical joke by a local illusionist. \n \n Undettered by such skepticism, a minority of particularly unorthodox clerics on the other hand claim that Corins apparition to our ruler is not just proof of her might, but also that we truly are her paragons, her chosen successors, her Gleaming Blade in a world filling with Darkness. Particularly fervent are the local clerics of Merenham itself, where a cult has already taken root. They preach the idea that when Corin fell in Castonath, while her body might have died right there, her soul travelled up the river and across the lake, finally landing in this very place, blessing the land before her final ascension. Their most radical suggestion, that some aspect of Corins soul might in fact have remained here, watching over the land, borders on outright heresy. Sensing an opportunity to become a holy site and attract pilgrims to the area, the burghers of Merenham have already sponsored the erection of a local shrine to this local patron saint, this supposed aspect of Corin, which they have dubbed The Lady of the Lake. \n Embracing this new belief might benefit us domestically, but would surely put us at odds with mainstream Corinite beliefs. \n \n And yet, you have seen it, have you not?"
 bop_flavor.13.a:0 "Blessed be Corin, thou shalt have thy shrine!"
 #WATERY_TART:0 "For our heresy, we will suffer a -75 opinion penalty with every Corinite country in Cannor."
 bop_flavor.13.b:0 "Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government."
 bop_flavor.14.t:0 "A Schism within the Blade Stewards"
 bop_flavor.14.d:0 "The Order of Blade Stewards, the traditional protectors of Calindal, the Gleaming Blade, has not been spared by the recent religious upheavals within the country.\nWith their seclusion during the Greentide having come to an end, they have seen a steady influx of volunteers. Even more so now that the old chivalric orders - considered a relic of Adeanic complacency - have been dissolved, with many martially inclined and zealous Corinites seeking a new home in the order. Yet they have quickly found themselves disappointed with the somewhat dull nature of monastic life, openly questioning their mission of mere protection of the blade and its chosen, rather than taking on a more active role. Some particularly radical members of the Corinite clergy are already suggesting that the Blade Stewards might in fact be agents of Adean as well, lulling us into passivity against evil. While even some of the older Blade Stewards are starting to reconsider their role, the more conservative minded ones among the order emphasize that it has always been dedicated to the blade and its chosen bearer first, rather than any religion, and should not simply submit to Corinite dogma."
 bop_flavor.14.a:0 "Lets hope they can all come to an agreement..."
 bop_flavor.15.d:0 "What might have boiled over into an open conflict has now seemingly resolved itself rather peacefully.\nThe Order of Blade Stewards has reformed, and its representatives have asked [Root.Monarch.GetName] for an audience to lay out their new mission. Though proclaiming itself to be fully dedicated to the Corinite cause, the order in reality espouses a syncretic belief system that declares Calindal an aspect of Corin, thereby directly bestowing her blessing on the Bladechosen. This clashes with the more orthodox interpretations of Corinite doctrine, which would argue that even those chosen by the blade are not immune from growing complacent against evil, though none among the clergy would dare level such an accusation against [Root.Monarch.GetName] – yet.\n\nIn addition, a militant wing of the order has been formed. They are calling themselves the Bladesworn, harkening back to the legendary warriors that served our kingdom during the age of Chivalric Escann. Clad in distinctive armor of pure white plate, they now stand before you. Many of them are former knights, adventurers, veterans of the Greentide, well equipped in arms and expertise. Seeking renewed purpose, they pledge their service and undying loyalty to the Bladechosen.\nMeanwhile, those stewards who would not lift a blade themselves have also found newfound purpose. The so called ‘Bladepriests’ have dedicated themselves to recruiting new volunteers and obtaining donations to their cause, above all, to finance the Bladesworn. They offer to spread the word of the Bladechosens good deeds in service to Corin.\nOf course, neither the nobility nor the clergy will be happy to see those infringements on their traditional domains of military and spiritual matters, but it would be folly to deny the assistance of what is essentially an estate of militant loyalists gifting you a personal army."
 bop_flavor.15.a:0 "Their support is welcome."

 bop_flavor.16.t:0 "The Marcher Rebellion of [GetYear]"
 bop_flavor.16.d:0 "In hindsight, the events of [GetYear] would appear unavoidable, for the position of the [Root.GetNobilityName] had been an untenable one from the beginning. With the reestablishment of the kingdom after the Greentide, a great influx of returning Marcher [Root.GetNobilityName] found themselves confronted with both upstart adventurers turned lords and a vibrant community of small freeholders. In the following arbitration, the upstarts were often favored over their ancients claims, leaving the [Root.GetNobilityName] with significantly less land then they had owned before. Later government policies further pushed temporary, non-inheritable land grants in rewards for military service, with complex inheritance laws that tended to shrink rather than grow estates over the generations. \n\nWith the emergence of the Bladesworn and their favoring by the crown and blade, and the general move towards a standing army, the [Root.GetNobilityName] saw another of its traditional domains infringed. With its exclusion from most of the officer corps, young nobles in search of a military career saw themselves confined to fields with little room for prestige or advancement, such as logistics or artillery.\n\nThis culminated in the Great Marcher Rebellion of [GetYear]. Faced with the only remaining possibilities of sinking into irrelevance or rising up, the [Root.GetNobilityName] chose the latter, many pawning off their last remaining estates just to hire mercenaries. Demanding control of the military and the return of lost ancestral lands, their demands were of a desperate nature, and only history would decide if this would be viewed as a great turnaround within the Blademarches, or merely the last desperate grasp for relevance from a dying breed."

 bop_flavor.17.t:0 "The Meritocracy at War and Peace Act of 1670"
 bop_flavor.17.d:0 "In the end, the act was more about a recognition of existing meritocratic trends within the realm, rather than the establishment of any such principle.\nAs is often the case in Blademarches, the army was the primary driver for reform. The legacy of the Adventurers of the Greentide, the practice of the Bladechosen, and the Corinite faiths emphasis on personal rightful struggle had led to a broad emphasis on merit over birth among the people. The Bladestewards and the Bladesworn had always accepted volunteers irrespective of gender or class, and with the state reserving the rights to recruit any willing peasant to its armies, and granting them land in return for their service, serfdom had been naturally eroded over time. Therefore, the act was simply a standardization and legitimization of what had been common practice for some time, removing the last legal remnants of those archaic privileges.\n\nFor the [Root.GetNobilityName], who had long since suffered the most due to those trends, it was in fact somewhat of a relief. Robbed of many of their privileges and holdings over the years, many of them would not even have qualified as noble in any other realm, and the act finally made them accept that. Embracing their role as mere citizens, many found success within commerce, the administration, or even the military. Positions that were denied to them on account of being part of the [Root.GetNobilityName] before were now open to them. Of many great houses – heroes of the Greentide, some even contemporaries of Clarimonde – nothing but their names remained."

 bop_flavor.18.d:0 "The test of the Blade is no longer the grand affair of old, where a whole dynasty might collapse as its latest scion proves unworthy of Calindal. Instead, our new ruler has been chosen by the Blade before the official inauguration, with the ritual before the assembled officials a mere formality. And yet, the people still bow in deference to the Gleaming Blade.\n\nAll hail the new Bladechosen, [Root.Monarch.GetName]!"

 bop_flavor.19.t:0 "The Universal Machine and the Great Gear"
 bop_flavor.19.d:0 "It is no secret that from the start, the ideology of the New Model was heavily influenced by the rationalist ideas emerging from the Ravelian societies emerging across the continent. At times, the New Models idea of 'total war' and 'the great war machine' has in fact been accused of quasi-religious undertones. Considered heretical under our past state religion, with our turn towards Ravelianism, these ideas have only blossomed into an even more controversial school of thought.\n\nThis new theory states that as we realize that there may be other spheres of existence, which are not in fact inhabited by the divine, but by creatures that only appear so through the lense of limited knowledge for now, and would, in time, become understandable to us - and thereby vanquishable - this realization will inevitably lead to conflict.\nFor while the gods would be unconcerned with us mortals, and not need to fear us, we could pose a danger to lesser creatures. These creatures, thereby being of mortal nature just like us, would inevitably come to the same rational conclusion. This would result in an inevitable arms race, with each sphere at first building up its defenses. As the others follow in response, they would become all the greater a threat. The only solution is therefore to destroy the other spheres inhabitants first, and quickly, before they can do the same to us. Therefore, the final great 'total war' to prepare for is this conflict of the spheres of existence itself. They call this process the 'universal machine', the analogy being that all are gears within it. It will eventually break down as they grind against one another, yet one cannot escape the machine.\nWithin this system, they believe that one needs to become the 'great gear' - one so large and powerful that it can in fact survive the breakdown of the machine, crush the smaller gears, and survive.\nSome describe their beliefs as milleniarist, though they firmly reject this. They argue that they do not look forward to such a scenario, and can't even predict when it will happen. But they view it an existential threat to be prepared for an protected against, to protect future generations against, by putting in the works and convcing others to do the same now, in the present.\nControversy runs rampant, and the movement has even been ridiculed as the 'Cult of the Huge Cog' by its critics, a term firmly rejected as obscene by its supporters."

Though there is no denying their value.

To preserve said reputation, so far we have refused to officially endorse any such venture, with some even suggesting that those who would sell their blade for gold are no true Blademarcher at all.\n\nOur advisors suggest that since such work is the worlds second oldest profession and won't go away anytime soon, it should at least be fully controlled by the state. In doing so, not only will we be able to uphold our reputation and some semblance of Blademarcher standards among the Sellblades - we would also stand to gain major profits and influence by directly selling contracts to foreign rulers."

 #Army Diversity

 bop_army_diversity.1.d:0 "The Elves are predictably small lipped about their military tactics, though not secretive - the techniques of the Wardancers, the songs of the Warsingers, the structure of the Jaherian Phalanx are all well documented and known to the humans. They have simply never been successfully replicated by them.\nFinally, a fair haired elven warrior maiden, after having soundly beaten a hundred of our best men in single combat reveals what she calls 'the secret':\n\n’Every day, you do a 100 situps, a 100 pushups, a 100 squats, followed by a 10 mile run. And you do this for several human lifetimes.’\n\nThis has been mostly unhelpful, though our generals agree that a bit more physical excercise certainly can't hurt out soldiers."
 bop_army_diversity.1.a:0 "Maybe the real discipline was the friends we made along the way?"
 bop_army_diversity.2.t:0 "Hobgoblin Drill"
 bop_army_diversity.2.d:0 "Our mission to the famously hostile Hobgoblins has been a risky one from the beginning, with many near-death situations along the way. Military secrets are hard to pry from a society so fanatically devoted to a singular martial purpose - this might be the real lesson here. While the Hobgoblins are of sturdier constitution then their more minute cousins, what truly sets them apart is their unwavering focus on drilling out individuality, and therefore, propensity for chaos, out of the individual. A hobgoblin soldier is truly no more than a cog in a machine, and better for it. While we already predict some issues with such an inflexible approach when faced with the more civilized armies of Cannor, there is still something to be learned here."
 bop_army_diversity.2.a:0 "Their drill and our technology will make us unstoppable."
 bop_army_diversity.3.t:0 "Harimari Ferocity"
 bop_army_diversity.3.d:0 "Somewhat ironically, the tactics of the Harimari, despite the obvious difference between our two races – them being tigers and all – have so far proven the most familiar to our delegation. Having fought against Elves, Humans and the monstrous Hobgoblins – certainly more organized the Orcs, yet no less ugly - alike, they have a long history of engagements remarkably close to ours – something hard to find in Escann, with our rather unique military approach. The Harimari also prefer the massed charge over the mass volley, and while many of their techniques are not replicable for lack of teeth, claws and four legs, there is still much to be gained from comparing our experiences to theirs. The delegation returns safely and successfully, even having made some friends along the way."
 bop_army_diversity.3.a:0 "We fully expected someone to get eaten by a Harimari, and are pleasantly surprised."
 bop_army_diversity.4.t:0 "Dwarven Siege Tactics"
 bop_army_diversity.4.d:0 "The Dwarves have the questionable honor of being considered ‘a bit stubborn’ even by the famously stoic members of the Blademarcher army. Being well-integrated within human society and slow to innovate, there is little about their military we do not already know. Their metallurgical skills are most impressive, but their secrets are well guarded, not to mention dependent on the vast forges and special ores only found in the Dwarovar.\nNonetheless, our observation of their military operations within the very same, clearing out the remnants of the Orcish warbands and goblin squatters, have provided some insights into the art of siege warfare, something that Blademarchers have never been particularly good at, often preferring to assault fortifications directly rather than wait, leading to high losses. The Dwarves have showcased some interesting techniques to breach the enemy walls with artillery, making such assaults less costly."
 bop_army_diversity.4.a:0 "Once more unto the breach."
 bop_army_diversity.5.t:0 "Gnomish Special Forces"
 bop_army_diversity.5.d:0 "The gnomes are a curious species, with tactics so alien to our own that at first we found it quite hard to find anything of value. With lines that would crumple under even the most incompetently executed charge by our soldiers and a physique that would not survive a single cut from our blades, they instead have to rely on raw firepower, skirmish tactics and various thingamajigs that our domestic industry has little hope of reproducing. \n Eventually, it did emerge that what at first appeared to be a great rabble of not even uniformly equipped soldiers did in fact represent a somewhat more thought out structure. It seems the gnomes favour highly specialized forces, often directly embedded with the more common infantry man. They call this ‘combined arms’, which to our skeptical delegation sounds suspiciously close to ‘dual wielding blades’ idea that overeager new officers keep proposing every other year, only to inevitably get turned down."
 bop_army_diversity.5.a:0 "More special forces are always good though."
 bop_army_diversity.6.t:0 "Strength from Diversity"
 bop_army_diversity.6.d:0 "Some within our military have questioned our travels to all the corner of the world in search of new expertise for our army. They argue that rather than going on a wild chase of other races military traditions, we should have invested some time forging our own, arguing that such a wild hodgepodge of ideas could never amount to a coherent doctrine.\n\n In doing so, they are missing the point. Our tradition is diversity. It is the human nature to adapt the ideas of others, improve on them, to find the best in all of them, to make them more than the sum of their parts, and to eventually make them our own. Humans did not invent the musket nor the mass volley, but they perfected it. The Elves forged Calindal, yet now we wield it.\nThose who would so closely cling to their traditions, their one area of expertise, that they become blind to the possibilities that are out there - eventually, they will all fall before the humans. "
 bop_army_diversity.6.a:0 "And I know the perfect name for such a doctrine."

But what about ten to one?\nTo elves, humans might as well be Goblins – with their frankly disconcertingly quick reproduction, they can simply drown you in bodies. Which is why today, pure Elven societies in Cannor only survive in glades at the edge of human domains. The Elves in Bulwar have done a bit better, but many of them have found themselves in a similar situation to ours, ruling over a human population that outnumbers them, and many of them have decided to replace their pure elven legions with humans instead.\n\nWe now face the same decision – should we preserve our Elven military, or replace it with a human one?"

Yet there will always be pure-blooded humans and orcs alike, and there is a push to allow them to join the army – and which general would say no to a few more warm bodies to throw at the enemy? At the same time, there are others who say that to do so would dilute our uniquely half-orc tactics and heritage. What is to be our decision?"

The final straw was the decision to force the Order to openly support the New Model, abusing their resources and reputation to further the militarization of the country.\nIt has now become apparent what those lost shipments of military supplies have gone to: The Order of Blade Stewards has raised a vast host of rebel Bladesworn, and with the New Model Army distracted by the recent war, those have now launched an open insurrection!\nA secret envoy of the Order has approached [Root.Monarch.GetName], proclaiming that they hold no ill will towards them or their line, only asking that we do not throw our name and blade behind the New Model establishment.\nThe very same has also approach us, and has been much more aggressive in their demands, openly demanding that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] denounce the Bladesworn uprising, or be considered a collaborator.\nSuch blatant disrespect for the Bladechosens authority is concerning, and there are some among our closest advisors who have suggested that our support for the radicals of the New Model might have been a mistake, undermining the Blademarcher monarchy.

They shall serve the people, as the blade shall now do, not the other way around. For while some of the people may even wish to govern themselves, there is no doubt that is should be the privilege of those born to rule."

 bladesworn_rebellion.18.d:0 "And so, the royal line shall come to an end - not with a whimper, but in a triumph! As [Root.Monarch.GetName] is proclaimed grandmaster of the Blade Stewards, and the Order fully takes over control of the administration of Blademarches, the road to greatness through sacrifice is laid out. The former monarch, surrendering their dynasties claim to the blade, only to rise to the noblest position of all. The former grandmaster, stepping aside, yet securing the brightest future for their order. An equal exchange, yet Blademarches itself will only profit doubly so! And it is needed. While the New Models idea of 'total war' was misguided, there is still merit in it - indeed, the blade whispers to us that a new age of strife is upon us, and all shall have to sacrifice if Blademarches is to survive!\n\nAcross Cannnor, they may look at us with disdain - mocking us as 'A Blade with a State'. A realm once on its way into the modern era, now organized into some archaic monastic order, still playing out dreams of knighthood in the age of powder and gun. Speaking of crusades and divine juddgement in an Age of Enlightenment! Robbed of its own nobility which could have kept the zealots in check, its people forced now have to toil in service, not even to a sovereign, but some magic sword!\n\nLet them mock us. We do not need them. We shall happily embrace what they call us: The lands, its people, united, equal, humbly serving, each to their best ability, fully dedicated to Calindal and its holy mission!"
