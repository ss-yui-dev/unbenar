We are not that familiar with the ice-steel techiniques used in it but it is still better than nothing, maybe we will uncover these tchniques with time ...\nthe exploration team is coming back as we speak.\n"

The only thing is to choose the direction we are going to take. Sould we focus on melee weapons and armors or bullets and firearms? we will be able to only choose one of them.\n"

# Ice-Giant's body event
 DA_ADK_explore.220.t:0 "Ice-Giant's Body"
 DA_ADK_explore.220.d:0 "Our exploration team has made a massive discovery, quite literally. What we believe to be an Ice-Giant's body, a 10 meters tall enormous creature, has been found dead in the lower dig levels. One interesting thing is that there is a massive ventilation system spreading in every direction from the room. The Ice-Giant gives off an unbelievable amount of frost energy just by existing and the Ice-Steel Forge in the higher Dig-Levels channels a little part of that energy in the Ice-Steel equipments from this ventilation system.\nIf we forget about the Ice-Giant for a moment, just by improving the ventilation system we should be able to improve our Ice-Steel equipment production efficiency significantly."
