 follow_the_path_of_hiderion_desc:0 "Scattered throughout the lands of Haless lie those elves left behind by the cataclysmic fall of the Phoenix Empire. Hunted out of vengeance and distrusted by most, they scrape by as best they can, living in squalor for centuries until they finally pass from this world. For most this seems a fitting punishment for the invaders and oppressors of this land, though others see a path for redemption. The great lord Hiderion ruled over his human subjects not as a tyrant but as their righteous guardian, a true servant of the people and a paragon of the ideals set by Jaerel.\n\nFor the elves of Haless to thrive in this land, they must do so as equals of those that have called this land home for millenia, united in harmony under an serene empire, built on the virtues Hiderion lived by. We must not rule Haless as conquerors, nor as her "saviors". We must rule as her guardians, protectors of the peace and sentinels against those that would seek to exploit her."

 DoHA_Halessi.9.t:0 "The Art of War"
 DoHA_Halessi.9.d:0 "Jiangdu was a worthy enemy to our kingdom. Although we may have bested them in battle, we pay respects to those who managed to make us fear. Unfortunately, we overcame said shock, and have sieged their lands. As the soldiers begin their march back home, a veteran soldier with many titles laid his sword on the field. He said:\n 'Today, marks a new era. Not just for us, not just for Yanshen, but for the whole world. We just happened to be the ones to make the difference.'\nWhile we believe that we were destined to unite those around us, we can't help but ponder his words. This truly seems like a new era. Let us pray it will be of peace and prosperity."
